"looking for a movie similar to Stay alive, with mix of computer games, and reality.",harunamika,"Hello i am looking a movie similar to the movie stay alive . So what i am more interested of this movie is that there is a mixed between video games and reality. There are other similar movies like ready player 1 ( [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/)) or Sword art online or hack@sign animes.  and such, so the movie could be not necesarily horror, it could be other genre, even anime, or series.  it could also be with all computer cgi . also it could be something like made in rosteer teeth series or etc.

2019 movies that hit you most emotionally?,funnypilgo,"What movies made you cry or nearly made you burst out in tears? Any movie characters you felt very emotionally attached to? (doesn't have to be sadness particularly) 

I usually find the best movies are those who create certain feelings that completely overwhelm you.

I wish there was more of Harvey Keitel in The Irishman.,AtreusStark,"He was setup to be this really big mob boss but after that restaurant scene he just disappears. That was disappointing. And the acting talent in that scene was just phenomenal. The way Harvey delivers his lines was outstanding but what was best was Joe Pesci in that scene. He says so much without uttering a word. You can just see the way he is concerned/worried at first, then relieved and later a bit amused. All of it just from his eyes.",movies

What movie would you show someone who doesn’t think the Holocaust was all that bad?,akinnae,"
I just learned that my friend’s brother has Swastikas plastered all over because he “thinks Hitler’s personality was cool.” Concerned, I questioned him and my friend and they both don’t seem to know much more about the Holocaust or Hitler than that people died. I wanted to have them read one of the great and/or touching books on the matter, but they say they don’t really read books; they only watch movies. I don’t know which one would be best to show them—I feel like it might be bad to show a highly fictionalized version given how it would be essentially their first exposure to the history, but also I’m not sure they would be as swayed by a documentary sort of thing. What movie do you think accurately portrays the important parts of the Holocaust &amp; its horrific-ness and thoroughly touches the heartstrings?",movies

Lets play a game; What if anything can the story for Matrix 4 be like to make it even a little interesting and/or relevant. Serious or not serious whats your pitch i dont care make it a comdy mine would be.,jarvis84,"This just seems so desperate and unnecessary. For gods sake try to make something new Hollywood. Reboots and sequels will be the death of the film industry. 

There may very well be somewhere the Wachowskis are going with this. But honestly i cant see it. Probably this either gona be a soft reboot or a dumb twist where they never won never defeated the machines or even left the Matrix for that matter and there is a Matrix inside a Matrix inside a Matrix B.S.


My suggestion;
If I was really doing this it would be a Terminator Matrix mash up - both franchises are pretty much dead anyway so why not go all in, go crazy, get weird. An agent Smith Terminator mix a horrible mutant abomination half Arnie half Hugo Weaving, think Toxic avenger or cronenberg like, its a prequel to Matrix 1 but a sequel to T2. Smith went back in time and merged with an T-100 Arnie, Neo and Trinity follow and meet a grown John Connor in post apocaolyptic LA fighting the machines, que some dumb joke about LA never looking better or some shit, the rest writes itself really. 
Complete insanity but pure gold.

"Every film I saw for the first time in 2019, reviewed in one sentence... [SPOILERS]",FeelThePower999,"War Games: ""The only way to win is to not play at all"", damn, this film is good (save for the shoehorned love story at the end).

Bandersnatch (Black Mirror): It's new, it's novel, it was an awful lot of fun!

Pulp Fiction: All I can say is, there's a reason this film has an absolute cult following!

Reservoir Dogs: I preferred Pulp Fiction by a long shot, but this was still good (shows how good Pulp Fiction was!)

Inner Space: A bit of fun, nothing too amazing... and a goddamned love story thrown in... as always...

The Da Vinci Code: Eh, I preferred the book. This movie was pretty average.

The Jerk (1979): This film was absolutely HILARIOUS (even with the love stories...)

Love Actually: I hate love stories as you can possibly tell, so what do I think about a film with 10 of them all interwoven? Actually... I really enjoyed this film, each story was very different, not all of them happy, and they all had different emotions and themes (this was 2 sentences, I know)

Steven Universe The Movie: I mean... it was alright, but it felt like 7 or 8 episodes of the TV show smooshed together, and didn't feel THAT special.

Seven: Hooo boy this was a fun ride!

The Graduate: What the.. what in the actual frozen blue HELL did I just watch?!

Apollo 13: I think what makes this film so good is that it's a true story that has the fairytale ending.

Flight 93: This film is an assault on the emotions.

Some Superhero Film: It was entertaining, but I can't for the life of me remember its name.

Yesterday: The concept for this film is absolutely INCREDIBLE... and I was really enjoying this film.... but the shoehorned love story absolutely RUINED IT!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!?!?!?!?? WHY!!?!?!?!? I actually almost walked out of the cinema during that scene in Wembley. I know I've gone way over one sentence, but that's the only way I can describe my HATRED for the ending of this film.

Rocketman: What an absolutely incredible look into the mind of the troubled Elton John!

Bohemian Rhapsody: Rocketman but with Freddie Mercury.

Cats (2019): No.

Stranger Than Fiction: Honestly I don't even remember what happens in this film.

The Butterfly Effect: Reminded me of that film with the time travelling closet I saw a few years back... but EVEN BETTER!!!

Donnie Darko: Similar themes to Butterfly Effect, but I didn't like this one nearly as much... the ending made no sense whatsoever and honestly, I was bored throughout most of it. (I know this is a cult classic... but it just didn't do it for me).

Electric Dreams: A decent film with an absolutely AMAZING song attached to it.",movies

We have made it tradition to watch Road House at least once that weekend.

However, we have gone through all available audio tracks on the DVD. This was the standard English/German set.

Are there any other published versions that you know of that contain different languages? The more exotic the better.

I remember he also directed his first film during those times. But now, cant seem to find him in any recent films. I know he also has a music career so it may be he is focusing on that?

Another example is Michael Fassbender. After he got married to Alicia Vikander I cant see this dude anymore. He was having roles after roles and working with top-tier directors but now it seems that his career is on a halt. Then he went into this whole weird car racing thing.",movies

I guess that's due to Donald Pleasance's great performance in the film, but I, for whatever reason want to watch a horror film where there is a character who has this relation to the antagonist, or whatever and can explain in well-written dialogue/monologue it's nature in a way that would make my skin crawl. 

Basically - I just want pure suspense. If you can't come up with what I'm asking for then at the very least please provide a recommendation for a horror film that has that **beautiful suspense in the vein of those AMAAAAZING first half and hour (or so) of  ""Train to Busan""** where there is this insanely well-executed tension of things happening right outside of main characters (and viewers) field of view and they don't know what's going on, but you do and seeing how you too don't exactly see the bloodshed and insanity your imagination does all the work for the film, thus further empowering tension.",movies

Help Me Find This Horror Movie!,KeroseneSkies,"I’ve been looking for a very specific horror movie because I can’t get one scene out of my head. I watched it when I was very young as I used to binge horror movie marathons. 
The scene is a woman (maybe naked or mostly naked) is suddenly pregnant due to demons or a ghost or something like that. She’s writhing around in pain and the pregnancy is like progressing super fast within the scene. She looks like she’s about to give birth and then the baby or demon or whatever rips her stomach open in like half or something and breaks out of her. I don’t remember if this woman was human or a vampire or something. Lots of blood and gore and screaming. I also think the room she was in is maybe red-ish in colour? Or dark in general? And I think she’s on a table maybe? I don’t remember if it was a bed or not. 
Does anyone know what this movie is? Every time I try to find it I get nothing similar.",movies

I watched Memento (2000) for the first time and - ironically - I don't think I'll ever forget it.,BobGoddamnSaget,"I've always sucked with watching movies. I always loved Chris Nolan, mostly because of Batman, but I have never watched any of his other films besides TDK trilogy and The Prestige. So, I see that Memento is on YouTube and I just went in blind and I'm so glad I did that.

This film may be 20 years old now, but I still don't wanna say too much. It's about a man with short term memory loss trying to find the person who murdered his wife. The presentation of this film is what makes it such a unique and original experience.

This is Nolan's 2nd ever film and its *soooo* good. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and do so. Don't read anything about it. Go in blind like I did. It's a way better experience.

If you have seen it, please, let's talk about it. None of my friends have heard of this movie lol",movies

The Lego Movie movies are about sorcery and transcendental wisdom.,breehyhinnyhoohyha,"Hear me out.  I don't have anywhere else to post this without sounding crazy, so bear with me.  I know this is a massively long post, so I won't blame y'all if you don't read it, I just needed to put this somewhere someone might actually read it who is interested.  Warning: this will be easier if you have an understanding of Kabbalah and Buddhism.

Okay, so my reading of The Lego Movie is that it's about transcendental wisdom and sorcery - the main character, Emmet, whose name is Hebrew for ""truth"", has a mind so blank, so empty, that he is able to move between his world and the world of the gods: i.e. he becomes capable of perceiving humans, and he realises that his life and the lives of everyone in his world are just humans acting out stories and plays on a smaller scale, and he is able to move independently without them controlling him, causing them to heal their relationship with each other, thereby bringing peace to his homeworld. In short, he manipulates spiritual forces to bring about a material effect in the physical universe. He does magic. He uses his will to change the world, and when he returns to his own plane of existence, seeing the world from outside gives him an instinctive understanding of the physical nature of reality, making him a Master Builder (essentially he has reached enlightenment and now possesses enlightenment kung fu superpowers).

I'm so sorry I slept on the sequel. It does the same IN REVERSE. The villain is someone who is able to move between his world and the upper world, but he does so accidentally, or recklessly, without the help of the gods (the humans accidentally drop him under an electrical appliance during play and he is lost, which is the wrong way of entering the human world; the right way is by a human deliberately taking him out of the play-world) and becoming stranded in the upper world without the spiritual strength to get back. This drives him insane with rage and grief, and instead of manipulating spiritual forces from a desire to do good, he manipulates them from a desire to destroy the world that he thought abandoned him, possessing an inversion of Emmet's power to build things, the power to break them down into their composite parts. He even names himself Rex, which signifies King, indicating the sense of ownership and mastery he feels he is owed by those that wronged him: he is a dark, unholy reflection of Emmet in every way, the Klippot to Emmet's Sefirot, demonic to Emmet's angelic.

And Lucy, whose name means ""light"" (when paired with Emmet who represents ""truth"" this recalls the Hebrew fortune-telling stones used by the Jewish High Priest urim and thummim, truth and light) attains spiritual enlightenment on her own, seeing the world from outside and understanding the nature of the Lego reality she lives in, and she transmits this knowledge to the rest of her friends, literally illuminating them and bringing them enlightenment, and together they manage to manipulate the human children into saving them from being packed away into a dark storage box forever. Lucy essentially leads her community in a magical ritual to compel the attention of their god to avert the apocalypse.

The Lego Movies are about attaining ever-higher levels of spiritual perfection, and the improved ability to move thorugh the world that comes with that, and the importance of using that wisdom for harmony, love and the fulfilment of the divine will.",movies

What does FilmBro actually mean?,PiggyTheRanga,"I know the basic concept... i think. 

i often see people who like Pulp Fiction and Fight Club being called 'FilmBros', same with people who like Tarantino and Nolan. So from what i've gathered, its the term given to people who watch only the popular movies? the people who like Tarantino and people like that? 

So for example, i think Tarantino is great, KB 1 and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood imo are pretty perfect films (i mean stuff like Pulp Fiction and Basterds is okay, personally dont see them as anything special). Is that considered a 'FilmBro' statement?

*i'm actually trying to know wtf this term means and why there are so many movies that are listed as film bro*",movies

2019 - Once Upon a Time in Hollywood

2015 - The Revenant

2013 - The Wolf of Wall Street

2012 - Django Unchained

2010 - Inception

Going back a bit further, The Departed, The Aviator, Gangs of New York, and Titanic were also nominated. That's 9 in total. Can anyone top that? Maybe Pacino, De Niro, Nicholson, or someone else?

Looking for some recommendations (spoilers for Joker and Parasite),SWFAN1000,"So, for the past several years, I’ve been watching nothing but Star Wars and the MCU. While I enjoy these franchises, and will undoubtedly be hyped for Black Widow in May, I feel a little burnt out of these franchises. Or, more specifically, action movies heavy with CGI. 

Sometime in around December, I watched Joker. It was one of the first drama/thriller/literally anything other than Star Wars or mcu movie I had seen in years. I loved it. I thought that it was a unique movie. I knew Taxi Driver was similar, but never got around to watching it. 

Fast forward to today. I had heard about Parasite for a few months, looked it up, and basically got “lower class meets upper class in South Korea”. I thought it sounded sort of like Crazy Rich Asians, because they both involve lower and higher classes in Asia. While it was nothing like Crazy Rich Asians, I loved it. Even more than Joker. 

So now, I’m looking for some recommendations. Movies like Parasite and Joker. I’ll try to make a list of what I liked

• dark. I really enjoyed the darker themes of both of these movies. 

•violence. I don’t need much, but I like at least a little bit. Maybe just 5 minutes near the climax. I don’t need to like a movie, but it adds some bonus points. 

•bittersweet or bitter ending. I feel that I wouldn’t have enjoyed Parasite nearly as much as I did without the sad, bitter ending. It wouldn’t have felt as satisfying if the 2 families had made up and been good pals after the lower class family was treated like shit. If a happy ending works for a movie, I’ll enjoy it. But I wouldn’t like a sweet ending when it isn’t deserved

•main character(s) being looked down on/being treated unfairly. I don’t think that many movies will have this, but I liked how Arthur was treated poorly because of his mental illness, and how the Kim family was treated like slaves by the Park family. It made the endings feel more just. 

Thanks for reading my essay of a post. I just love these movies, and how I think about them for weeks after seeing them.",movies

A theory of The Lighthouse,MeLikesPineapples,"Watched this film last night (with subtitles) and I am amazed at what an absolute snub this was. Should have had nominations for Best Picture, Actor, Supporting Actor, Original Screenplay, Sound Mixing, Editing. At least it got recognised for Cinematography I think? 

WARNING: Heavy spoilers below. 

Anyway, I was completely immersed into this film right from the start. The sirens had a pretty haunting, yet gripping element to it.

I came across a comment on YouTube where they said this island is actually purgatory. I loved this theory and it makes absolute sense. Pattinson's character mentions he killed a person (or at least watched them die when he could have stopped it). The light room is basically the gateway to heaven (as the saying goes ""Follow the light""). Light has a significant spiritual connotation, with angels, heaven, pure beings (being cleared of sins).

Willem Dafoe is the keeper of the gates who decides if Pattinson deserves to go to heaven. There are numerous tests. Maybe enough to meet the 7 deadly sins?

LUST - Mermaid
GLUTTONY - Finishing the rations
GREED - Motive to embark the lighthouse mission ($1000)
SLOTH - Drinks himself to sleep the day the ship was to come and rescue them
WRATH - Kills the keeper 
ENVY - Wants access to the lightroom
PRIDE - Breaking the mermaid toy and claiming he saw through it? 

All of these are tests, we can see Pattinson has failed all 7 of them.

That's probably why the light pushed him back and knocked him down the stairs. He was rejected by heaven. And him being pecked to death is his path to hell, perhaps.

The movie could have been 10 minutes shorter I reckon, but I still loved it a lot. The Captain fapping in the light room while Pattinson watches, with jizz oozing down was a bit too goddamn much",movies

It: Chapter Two was extremely disappointing - and even feels rushed despite being nearly 3 hours.,broheimlich,"What a letdown of a movie. The chemistry between the cast was terrible, and the only character I bought as their grown up counterpart was Bill Hader as Ritchie. He was great. There were some moments between the cast such as Bill and Bev's kiss that felt completely unearned and did nothing for me as the two had barely interacted since reuniting. In terms of the scares, there really weren't any that got me. That stupid zombie/leper CGI was so overused that by the third time I saw it I wanted to turn the movie off. The only interesting monster design was Pennywise's spider form toward the end, but that wasn't even scary, just interesting. Finally, Henry Bowers. What an underdeveloped, uninteresting villain. They barely have him any screen time, the acting was terrible anyway, and then he just sort of dies and that's it. I know it's kind of that way in the book but it just felt even more underdeveloped in the movie. To summarise, extremely disappointing movie that I wouldn't watch again. 3.5/10.",movies

PARASITE: help find and justify/argue as many forms of parasite/parasitic action within the film.,hihowarejew,"google define: parasite:

* 1. an  organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host)  and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.  
""the parasite attaches itself to the mouths of fishes""
* 2. derogatory - a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.  
""the capitalist is really a parasite on the workers""

\-----considering definition 1. expense doesn't necessarily mean harmful, as there are different forms of symbiosis eg. mutualistic, commensalistic, parasitic etc.

also- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism#Variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism#Variations)

potential parasites-  
\-tuberculosis bacteria living on its host, and often contracted from a parasitic worm   
\-the insects within the semi basement.  
\-the kim (poor) family and their actions from free wifi and pest control (commensalistic) to stepping on others to take positions from others (parasitic)  
\-the park (wealthy) family relying on others to operate a house hold (commensalistic or mutualistic depending on how you view their salaries considering they have more to give and its implied that its not enough for the kim to progress out of their class structure)  
\-mr park and his tech company being capitalistic. relying on drivers and firing initial driver without much consideration.  
\- Gook Moon-gwang and her husband (ultra-poor/indebted/basement family) for obvious reasons of food and living within the household. put in this situation due to the parasitic nature of loan sharks which i believe was a result of his failed business of king castella (the cake shop mr kim once worked at which failed to oversaturated market) which attempted to capitalise on the pastry craze of the rich

You know, that swirly/radical bokeh, the focus is normally pretty shallow in the shots — I know I’ve seen it before!

Any help on identifying films that have this effect would be greatly appreciated",movies

Misleading trailers,j234_,"There's plenty of memorable misleading trailers out there, my personal favorite is 2007's Georgia Rule- the movie was amazing but it was savaged by critics and I think the ad campaign has a lot to do with it, the marketing team made it look like a sweet dramady about familial bonding when in reality, while theres some of that, the movie is really mostly about Lindsay Lohan's character admitting the she was raped repeatedly for 2 years by her stepfather. I wouldn't have been surprised if it got an F Cinemascore (it got a B-). Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and LiLo are all terrific and Feel the movie would have done better if it had been advertised properly. Another famous one is Bridge to Terabithia.

Rex Reed is Again Reviewing Movies He Didn't Watch,FlyingDadBomb,"I saw The Gentlemen last night. I liked it fine, but I suspect I'll soon forget about it.

Then I saw one zero-star review on Metacritic that piqued my interest, and it was from who else but Rex Reed. Now I'm not taking issue with Mr. Reed's conclusion here - critics are not ""good"" or ""bad"" depending on whether or not people agree with them or whether they agree with the majority (a common fallacy).

But when your review contains several factual inaccuracies and raises a fair question of whether or not you even watched it, you might be one of the bad ones. Enter Rex Reed's Gentlemen Review:

1. [He writes](https://gyazo.com/84f58e6d915ab9738ea9feb1f7e5b01d) ""\[Matthew McConaughhey\]'s kingdom includes a dozen strategically hidden country estates where his gang uses the latest technology to grow and market a lethal drug called ""white widow super cheese.""
   1. This is not ""a lethal drug"" (and I'm not sure how one would intend to profit off a drug that kills its users, but OK). This was a euphemism for Marijuana. It's literally impossible not to know he's selling marijuana if you watched even a portion of the film. It is baked into the premise of the movie and how it plays out. [Here's a link to a screenshot of him surround by marijuana plants](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm8sjV8KLnAhUSvZ4KHa1jA_wQjRx6BAgBEAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mic.com%2Fp%2Fguy-ritchies-the-gentleman-features-matthew-mcconaughey-as-a-weed-kingpinin-london-18843698&amp;psig=AOvVaw2YmcP-BkAeRaQImv1zTLPA&amp;ust=1580178187077023). And that is far from the only example.
2. [He writes](https://gyazo.com/c2f97762f185a2830f6b30bd3584261b): ""Add junkie rock stars, Russian oligarchs, victims frozen to death in meat lockers, feuding Chinese drug gangs, projectile vomiting and carnivorous pigs.""
   1. There is not a single ""junkie rock star"" character.
   2. There are two victims who are killed on screen and later frozen (and not in meat lockers). This is made exceptionally clear by the movie.
   3. There is only one Chinese gang, and while there is some infighting, I don't know how anyone watching the movie (let alone a serious reviewer) could think there were two gangs.
   4. The scene I suspect is the source of the ""Carnivorous pigs"" involves a magazine editor being shown a video of himself, drugged, in which the film implies he is fucking a pig. So think about that: Rex Reed saw that part and thought the editor was being shown a video of himself being eaten by a pig. What in the actual fuck?

There are a few other smaller issues in the review, but those are the most glaring and really suggest that he just didn't watch most or even any of the film and made up stuff to fill in the blanks.

In case this sounds familiar, you may remember that Rex Reed has done this before, with The Cabin in the Woods, where he said the plot of the movie was that the horror cabin was actually a video game and that vampires ""circle the moon and suck the hot stud's blood."" \[[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20120722043554/http://www.actclassy.com/2012/04/a-review-of-rex-reeds-review-of-the-cabin-in-the-woods/)\]

I'm not linking to Reed's review, and I hope other's don't as well. Don't reward this guy for not doing his job. But it's insane that his review is titled ""The Gentlement proves Guy Ritchie is one of the worst directors of our time."" Really? A movie you didn't watch is proof of a director's quality? Nice.

"Sending fan letters, proper etiquette?",Lowkey_HatingThis,"So I've been wanting to write Ennio Moriccone a fan letter for some time. I think he's the greatest film composer of all time by far, and Sergio Leone's movies wouldn't be the pieces of art they are without his music. 

I saw that a lot of people send pictures and money for postage, and he signs the pictures along return. I realize he's pretty old and would love to have him sign something.

The only things I have are a 24x36 poster for once upon a Time in the west, and a 27x40 Italian The Good The Bad and The Ugly poster. 

Of course, I'd love to have him sign these, but they're pretty big. If I paid the postage, and put in the money for return, would that be fine? Or are they far too big to send? I don't want to be outlandish and at the same time praise someone's work. 

And just generally anything else about sending a fan letter. I saw he had some agency in the Netherlands taking his fan mail, but others said that this wasn't a good address and to use his home address. Am I allowed to just send straight to his address?

Thanks",movies

Question about Ready or Not (2019),young-henry,"So, I have seen Ready or Not twice, once in theaters, and once the other night on Blu Ray. In theaters I missed a bit of the movie because I went to get popcorn and they were still cooking it, so I missed a bunch of time. The second time I saw it I caught a lot of what I missed, but it was in a group of loud friends, so I still missed some dialogue here and there. My question is about Alex, the husband. The family says that Alex “got out” which I’m assuming means the contract with the devil. At the end he only dies as a result of the curse once Grace says “I want a divorce” my question then would be how did he get out of the deal with the devil? It doesn’t make sense to me that it would be because he married Grace because of that were the case they wouldn’t have to play the game at all. Can someone help me figure out what I must have missed or maybe misinterpreted?",movies

First up, I cannot remember the names of any of the actors or actresses but I do remember the plot okay. It's been a while so I am spotty on certain parts, so anything might help.. If anyone knows it, I will be forever indebted.

The plot is like this:

A group of people are in a diner over night. They are all their for their own various reasons. At one point one of the employees starts getting calls or texts (can't remember 100%) from someone threatening to do something bad if their instructions aren't followed precisely. There is the suggestion that it might be someone there, but the villain is certainly watching them, so the orders must be followed precisely. People are getting picked off, I believe, one by one, leading the protagonist - who I am 90% sure is female -  to call the police and lock themselves in the storeroom hoping the wait out the night and survive. They let one other survivor in with them because they seem okay and hope the two will live. In the end it is revealed that his mild mannered person is the one that has been orchestrating the whole thing and now the protagonist has locked themselves in with a murderer. I remember that the end heavily implies that the protagonist is killed as you hear the rescue sirens arrive, but its not onscreen.

I need a movie that shows a group rising up against an oppressive system,existential_fish,"Hey everyone.

Bit of a weird question but for one of my assessments I need to relate a text to George Orwell's 1984.

My idea was that I would relate the tragic ending of Winstons individual struggle for autonomy against the party to a movie where a group successfully rises up and challenges an oppressive system. My thesis would be that people are much more powerful as a collective and that if people want to make change then they must group together. I was already thinking along the lines of star wars but it would help to have more options.

Is Rambo: Last Blood (2019) worth watching?,Excellent_Log,"I love First Blood, one of my all-time favorites. The story, setting, atmosphere, characters, music, ending, everything. But it wasn't always like that, especially not when I first watched the trilogy as a kid back in the 90s. I thought the second and a third movie were marvelous, action, blood, guns, explosions, while the first movie felt like an introduction, Rambo had yet to become a badass war machine.

But, as I've said, over time and growing up I realized the cheesiness of the sequels and the depth and emotion of the original. Second and third are just regular 80s action movies, while the First Blood explored a totally different territory - a man alone in the world, used like a sock and abandoned. John Rambo (2008) managed to capture some of it, Rambo's inner battle and the most beautiful ending ever, John finally coming home, after a life of war and death, to the sound of ""It's a long road"". A full circle.

I just watched the trailer of Last Blood and, even though I understand I couldn't have grasped much just by trailer, I felt like Rambo's character is really off. Rambo I know doesn't behave or speak like that. He could almost pass for an angry Stallone.

Any stories of horror movies your parents or family took you to as a young kid and scared you afterwards?,whatevermojo,10 years old and my Mom took me to see Magic (1978) Anthony Hopkins and then next time I come home from school I had a ventriloquist doll sitting in the corner of the room.  My brother got the clown from poltergeist years later. Some may say that was mean but Mom is a great gal and it really started my love of horror.,movies
If you like the movie “We Need to Talk About Kevin” you really need to watch “Bloodlines”,tylerdurden1993,"It’s on amazon prime video and it was absolutely incredible. It’s about a psychopath doctor, but any more would spoil it. It’s an amazing psychological thriller. Obviously it’s a bit disturbing at times. I can’t believe I haven’t heard of it before. It’s only 80 minutes so give it a watch.",movies

About the Oldboy (2003) finale,ChronicTheOne,"Just finished watching the film after watching it over 15 years ago. Masterpiece.

I was reading about the ending online and it seems ambiguous as to whether he is the Monster in the end or himself. I am pretty sure he chose to be the Monster due to 4 hints:

1) he's found far away from the chairs. His oblivious form stayed still while the Monster walked ""until he was 70"".

2) in an early part of the film he starts recalling who he might have wronged in the past and he admits he has done a lot of wrongdoings and names himself a Monster.

3) the sentence mentioned in the beginning and ending about being worse than a beast but still deserving to live fits better with being a monster and living with that fact.

4) and finally something I didn't see anyone mention: his hair is greyer than it was before the hypnosis, confirming he's now ""70"" and old. So he's the monster.",movies

He won the Oscar for the best leading actor, which is obvious when talking about his performance, but wasn’t Vito the supporting role in the film? Cause from what i see at least, isn’t Michael’s Al Pacino the leading character in the Godfather right?",movies

"Despite it's critical acclaim, I thought Roma was just ok",Sedinery97,"I was pretty underwhelmed by it overall and was wondering if anyone else felt the same. Maybe its sorta my fault cause I had very high expectations going in from all the praise it's been getting over the past year but man was this a slow slow film that didn't have any pay off for me whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography, performances, sound and overall tone and atmosphere are all top notch and practically perfect, so I was able to enjoy how well made it was and some of the beautiful shots throughout (especially the one near the end in the water). Overall I feel like I probably would've liked it more if I saw it in a theatre cause it probably would've really sucked me in but for me I just couldn't get invested and found myself just waiting for either something interesting to happen or for me to start really feeling something. I feel like the main character was very uninteresting cause she's basically a saint and a perfect person who we don't really get to know very well and it felt like she was just there for you to feel bad for. Overall I find the majority of Cuaron's films to be style over substance and I think this one fits that as well. He did a phenomenal job of capturing Mexico in the 70s but once again I didn't care about what was happening. I'm just curious if I'm alone on this cause for the most part all I see is people fawning all over it and calling it a masterpiece.",movies

"I'm looking for movies that have female narrations at the beginning, like in terminator 2, anyone?",JetpackRescue,"I'm trying to find movies where there's a female speaking at the beginning of the film, basically laying out the story, similar to the [Terminator 2 intro scene](https://youtu.be/_Mg7qKstnPk). (linked youtube video of the scene)

It's for narration over a space scene, telling the story of how the multiverse was created, it's telling a terrible event that happened.

I know I've seen scifi space movies with females narrating the beginning of the film, but for the life of me I just can't find any.

Does anyone know of any?",movies
Is Star Wars: The Last Jedi the most controversial blockbuster ever made?,Vadermaulkylo,"I’ve been thinking about this and I think it just might be. It’s a movie I’ve seen people call genius and also call idiotic. I’ve seen it called one of the best sci-fi movies ever and one of the worst movies ever made, it’s either in your top 3 favorite Star Wars movie or is in last place. Hell some people say it ruined the entire franchise for them.

I have never seen a blockbuster divide people like it did. I personally love the movie, but every person I know hates it. On that account, some people online despise the movie, but some people adore it. I guess people could say the prequels, however no one really called them brilliant and the hate they got may not be as bad as the hate for TLJ, and that’s REALLY saying something. 

So I just want to know, is there any other blockbuster in history that has people that divided? Has one movie ever made people completely turn on a franchise they grew up on before? I truly think it might be the most divisive movie made in the 21st century.",movies
