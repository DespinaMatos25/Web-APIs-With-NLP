Book Suggestions for my husband and I to read together in 1 month,spiritofthesquirrels,"My husband and I have decided to start and finish 1 book over the course of a month as part of a 12 part, month to month New Years resolution. This is our resolution for 1 month this year. 

I’m looking for suggestions that will keep us both engaged. I like to read already (fantasy, magic, futuristic dystopia, crime). My husband barely/never reads novels and if he does it is usually practical advice or military inspired (not my thing unless it’s history). So I’m looking for a book we would both enjoy AND get something from. Meaning a new love for reading, good conversation/new series, or actual life tips.. I realize most books will do this, but I can usually never convince him to read, so I want to make this one a hit!

The one where Friends spoils Little Women,ladydadas-nightmare,"I just started reading 'Little Women', and was enjoying so much, it's so easy to read! Then I remembered an episode of 'Friends' mentioning this book and The Shining. I know spoilers are a sensitive subject, especially around classics, but on my opinion you shouldn't spoil other stuff on series/movies, it may sound harsh but ""they don't have the right"" (and Friends is really popular, so it reaches more people). I won't stop reading it though, I rarely ever pause or stop a book, and I'm really enjoying this one.

On a side note, I know it's almost a mandatory read in US and some countries, but my reality is this: 19 year old girl from South America. This book and similar ones aren't discussed much, so it took me a while even to discover it, and shows like 'Friends' have a worldwide success. Our school reads are different ones.

Anyway, rant over, just wanted to get it off my chest haha. And as I said, still enjoying the story!",books

Harry Potter and the Vanishing Editor,newfriend999,"**The Harry Potter books are perfect and holy in every way, but – can they be improved with another polish, and how?** 

**How would you edit the Harry Potter books?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Go Set A Watchman, published in 2015, was the most pre-ordered book since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The publicity claimed Go Set A Watchman as Harper Lee’s sequel to her iconic 1960 novel To Kill A Mockingbird. Bookshops threw midnight launch parties, echoing Harry Potter.

But Go Set A Watchman is not To Kill A Mockingbird’s sequel. It is the book’s first draft. 

In 1960 this first draft was transformed from “a series of anecdotes”\* into a “fully-conceived novel” — or in the author’s words, a “good idea” into “a gem”. Editor Tay Hohoff helped Harper Lee refocus the story on six-year-old Scout, and encouraged her to drop chapters with the same character as a young woman. The novel they crafted, To Kill A Mockingbird, won the Pulitzer Prize.

&amp;#x200B;

**Harry Potter and the Vanishing Editor**

The Harry Potter series became a thing apart with its fourth entry, published in July 2000: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. To prevent spoilers, release dates in the UK and USA were synced. The midnight release parties began. And that September, filming started on the first movie. 

The first three books emerged as a fairly regular piece of publishing, but from Book Four onwards, Harry Potter is an industry. By the fifth book JKR was described as being richer than The Queen. Soon after, she became the first author billionaire.

*How can an editor tell the billionaire goose to revise her golden eggs?* This author is way too powerful. 

&amp;#x200B;

**For the Flintz**

Harry Potter exploded into internet chatrooms at the dawn of the new millennium. Committed early fans nominated themselves as editors and flagged up inconsistencies. Marcus Flint, who played Chaser for the Slytherin Quidditch team, was in his sixth year in Book One. Yet he remains on the team in Book Three (Hogwarts students leave after seven years). Oops. Fans noticed the error and JK Rowling tagged such slip-ups as “Flints”. To correct, Marcus became a fifth year in reprints of The Philosopher's Stone. (Real editors play second fiddle to the readers.)

Meanwhile, the author incorporates ideas from fans. In Book Six, Ron refers to the makers of the Marauder’s Map as “The Marauders”. Why? To service fans who ~~didn’t understand apostrophes~~ had grouped Remus, Peter, Sirius and James as The Marauders since The Prisoner of Azkaban. 

The need for plot secrecy also tied the editors’ hands. Eyes on each manuscript were heavily restricted. No chance to share a problem with a colleague without breaking contract! The atmosphere around the books becomes uptight. One editor’s difficult question may interrupt the productivity of the Harry Potter industry. 

The first rule of business: serve when hot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Mea Culpa**

Jo Rowling has made excuses for three Harry Potter books: 

\- Chamber of Secrets: she had writer’s block. 

\- Goblet of Fire: she had a story crisis and spent a lot of time on rewrites. she struggled to hit the deadline agreed with her publishers. Pottermania was in full swing, and the movies underway. 

\- Order of the Phoenix: writing OotP was a chore, she ran out of time and energy at the finish. 

And marriage and babies and interviews and the charity and politics. Like her main character, JKR had too much going on ~~to be a prefect~~.

""There were a couple of the Potters and I definitely knew that they needed another year,"" she told the BBC in 2012. ""I had to write on the run and there were times when it was really tough. And I read them, and I think 'Oh God, maybe I'll go back and do a director's cut', I don't know.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Stephen is our King**

When the role of editor is diminished, the writer’s imperfections shine. 

Horror writer Stephen King is the world’s second biggest author, worth about half JKR. He championed and mused upon\*\* the Harry Potter books: 

“As a writer she is often careless,” he wrote in his review of Book Five\*\*. “Characters never just put on their clothes; they always ‘get dressed at top speed’.” 

“The part of speech that indicates insecurity is the adverb,"" wrote King, ""and Ms. Rowling seems to have never met one she didn’t like, especially when it comes to dialogue attribution.” The best-known adverb in HP? “Dumbledore asked calmly.” But ""Dumbledore said simply"" is more prevalent. 

King made notes: Sirius – “exasperatedly”, Mrs Weasley – “sharply”, Tonks – “earnestly”, Harry – “quietly”, “automatically”, “nervously”, “slowly” and “ANGRILY”. 

King went on: “These minor flaws in diction … are the logical side effect of a natural storyteller who is obviously bursting with crazily vivid ideas and having the time of her life. Yet Ms. Rowling could do better, and for the money, probably should. In any case, there’s no need for all those adverbs (he said firmly), which pile up at the rate of 8 or 10 a page.”

&amp;#x200B;

**The Perils of Structure**

The Harry Potter books contain a beautiful gay relationship that ends in tragedy. Remus Lupin spends 40 lines (across three books) simply looking at Sirius Black, before the latter dies in a fight with Bellatrix Lestrange at the Ministry of Magic. Then this story line evaporates. 

JKR is a genius at forward planning and foreshadowing. But there is a flaw in the careful plan. Being fixated on the end goal she cannot allow her characters to speak to her. To fix the end goal of orphan Teddy Lupin, she smothers the flame of Sirius + Remus. 

And Remus fights back! In The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows, he resists his relationship with Nymphadora Tonks, resists marriage and resists fatherhood. He would much rather hang out with two 17-year-old boys (and, if he must, Hermione). 

JKR felt Harry and Hermione pull together. This magnetism is palpable when Ron is absent in The Deathly Hallows. Harry even takes Hermione to visit his parents in Godric’s Hollow. They hold hands. There's a kissing gate. But a late-breaking romance between Harry and Hermione is not in the story plan, even if readers feel the frisson. Would a foolish coupling, one that can be blamed on the Slytherin Horcrux, have made the final book more epic? Screenwriter Steve Kloves made Harry and Hermione dance, to show the temptation and the characters’ decision to resist. JKR ignores the risk. She sacrifices these organic moments and succumbs to her pre-existing structure. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Insert Joke Here**

The final HP books wrap up the stories of Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort and Snape, but… are they finished works? 

JKR’s story plan keeps the essential elements of the story safe. But having the path laid out allows the author to skim across details. Several times Fred and George do something funny and everyone laughs – but we are not supplied the joke, only a nod to some antics. Possibly JKR is bored of the characters. Possibly she was hot to write another passage and planned to double back. 

Whatever, the basic rule of show-not-tell is ignored, which leaves vague holes. Harry’s schoolmate Dean Thomas\*\*\* drifts twice into the story in The Deathly Hallows – by coincidence! The story's romances feel forced. Ginny, who blossoms with interest through the stories, becomes a trophy in the final book, an object Harry repeatedly puts away for safekeeping. 

An empowered editor would smooth away these curiosities and make good the minor beats as well as the major ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Good or Good Enough**

Jo Rowling finished Harry Potter in January 2007. All was well. The end. 

Except there is no letup. Only last year: four new Hogwarts e-books, which unlock seven subjects from the Hogwarts syllabus. A third Fantastic Beasts movie, which promises more Albus Dumbledore, goes into production this spring. Plus, the Pottermore. Plus the Twitter. 

If JKR can change the books to amend “Flints”, if she can consider her own “Director’s Cut”, and if she can continue to publish supplementary material to ensure the books are interpreted exactly as she intends, is Harry Potter an ongoing work-in-progress, like the movie Blade Runner (four versions, one sequel and counting)? And is the author the person who decides? Something wonderful about the Wizarding World: readers/fans fill the gaps with their own imaginations.

Thirteen years ago this month JKR defaced a bust of Hermes in her suite at Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel to mark a full stop on Harry Potter. I'm doubtful that her editor was in the room at the time. “It All Ends Here” claimed the publicity for The Deathly Hallows. But not really.

Which book to read based on your mood?,dreamerimagine1,"Books when you feel angry at the world and all you wish for is an apocalypse: Things we lost in the Fire by Mariana Enriquez- Well, this is not a feeling we accept to others, but sometimes when the rage becomes uncontrollable, Things we lost in the Fire is perfect to read while indulging in your revenge fantasy. This short story collection is diabolically dark and has such an unsettling magic that you will be afraid to continue with the next story, yet you'll not be able to put it down.


When you are melancholy and confused at the same time: Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami- There is a lingering sadness in each page of the book like a needle pricking your skin which you cannot locate. This novel is especially best if you read it during winter wearing gloves and your breath rising as a silvery wisp.

When you've had enough of other people's BS: Circe by Madeline Miller: Nothing speaks empowerment than an overlooked witch in classical Greek tragedies who's made a heroine of her own right by the delightful pen of Madeline Miller. It has such an engaging plot and a strong but vulnerable character who we can't help but root for.

When you are melancholy but introspective: The Gift of Rain by Tan Twan Eng- The Gift of Rain is a hauntingly beautiful tale set in the backdrop of Japanese invasion of Malaya. The imagery is gorgeous and the characters are beautifully complex. The plot has multiple layers of survival, mysticism, family and love. If you can read just one book from this list, this is the one. 

When you've lost faith in humanity:
1. Tiny Beautiful Things by Cheryl Strayed- This is a gem of a book which will restore your faith in the beauty of being human. Extracted from the column Dear Sugar on Rumpus, each letter and its answer will make you cry, laugh or sometimes both.

2. This Modern Love by Will Darbyshire- There is just one word for it- Heartwarming.

3. Chicken Soup for the Soul: Women to Women

4. Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom: Book that will never fail to make you cry.

When you're stuck in your sweltering small town and it makes you claustrophobic: Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn- Diabolically, wicked women who'll make your skin crawl whom you can't help but secretly wish to be like them.

When you want to get lost in a good story during midsummer- The Lake House by Kate Morton- Reading Kate Morton's novels is going back to the old days gone with the wind. The Lake House is a delightful novel to read with an engaging plot which surprises you.

When you are more than interested in the forbidden secrets of your town: Into The Water by Paula Hawkins- It has an autumnal feel with all its mystery and secrets. Add to it, all those witchy references!

When you just want to escape your real life: Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern- The descriptions are enchanting and the book makes a great autumnal read if you want the taste of a fairytale of grown ups.",books

I just read 1984 and experienced ego death,ExtremelyIntelligent,"Let me get this straight - I am not an avid reader. I always assumed books were only for chodes with PhDs. In fact, once I read the back of a cereal box and it gave me a migraine. God I was so ignorant back then. Fortunately for me, a hero on Reddit recommended the book ""1984"". I told him I was too busy playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for PlayStation 4 to read a dumb book about a year, but my internet died, so I said okay. He told me that you could pick up books at the local library, which, while confusing (they just give you free shit?) was a thrill for me. After visiting the library, with clammy palms, I returned with the cold book in my hands and started reading. 

Almost immediately, my hands starting tingling. The parallels to modern times blasted my brain into the cosmos. I started seeing shapes, and hearing quotes in my head like ""War is peace."" and felt the urge to text that to all my friends. Time became infinite. I had transcended the fabric of space and above earth I saw all the dumb plebeians of the world, who were too dumb and lazy to read, unlike me. I felt that in this 5th dimension, Orwell was there with me, telling me I'm really smart. Wow.

When I finished the book and returned to the world of the living, it was 9pm, and I was completely covered in sweat. I heard my mom's voice - apparently she had being calling me downstairs for chicken nugget dinner for the past 2 hours. When I told her about my experience, she said ""That's nice honey."" She had no idea.

Anyway so I'm a little late to the club but I'm happy to say I'm a reader now! I'm thinking of reading Dune next, as my reddit friend says the effects can be even stronger than with 1984! Any other suggestions for books I can experiment with?",books

"We're all familiar with 'gimmicks' in films (long takes, playing with audio-visual syncing, 3D), but are there any gimmicks in books that authors have used to try to enhance their work?",TheUnknownStitcher,"The only ones that come to mind for me are:

* Lipograms - Books written without a specific letter.

I've only read Survivor and it was fine - the gimmick didn't really add anything other than ""oh, neat"" to my reading experience. I used to own a copy of House of Leaves but I only got a few pages into it before I got sucked into something else, and I don't think I've ever read a lipogram.",books
Behind Closed Doors - My experience.,morrisonlikessamoyed,"I recently completed *Behind Closed Doors* by *B. A. Paris* and I would like to share my thoughts.

I am an avid reader of psychological crime thrillers and I prefer fast-paced books with minimal descriptions. This novel had both these qualities. The story took off right from chapter one and kept the tension running up to the end.
  *Plot summary without spoilers*

Grace is a 32 year old, working woman, yet to get married. Getting in a relationship has always been difficult for her because of a certain bundle that she willingly carries with her; - Milly. Milly is Grace's 17 year old sister, with Down's Syndrome. Grace has always been Milly's primary caregiver and guardian and she is determined to keep it that way for the rest of their lives. Finding a man that would willing accept Milly into their personal lives, as a perpetual presence &amp; liability, hasn't been favorable for Grace and she thought she would have to remain a spinster for life; that is till she met Jack. 
    
   Jack was every thing a woman could dream of and more. Almost too perfect to be real. He's a well-established lawyer, popular among friends, kind, gentle, considerate. Most importantly, he accepted Milly as his own, since the day they met and promised Grace that Milly would be his family and responsibility forever. Milly seemed to like Jack as well. It was only normal, though some might say "" it's too soon"", that Grace accepted Jack's proposal and decided to get hitched after just six months of meeting Jack...

The story is from Grace's POV as she continues to live her life, one year after her marriage with Jack and tells us about parts of her life in the past year, events leading up to the present. 


There are a few weak spots in the story which can be annoying but the whole novel in general is very engrossing. It is a brisk page-turner and hence doesn't take long to finish. The flow is simple. The story is fairly compact and fast-paced and there are characters to root for/ lovable characters (not like those stories where all the characters are dislikable). The descriptions are straightforward yet vivid which I love. 

The ending felt a little abrupt but the story was wrapped up well, I think. 


Would recommend it to anyone who is fan of domestic psychological thriller, looking for an easy weekend read.",books

Henry Miller Revisited,NimrodCain,"I first read the Tropics in my early 20s; reading them now in my 30s, I'm still amazed at his genius. He is, to me, one of America's greatest writers. It is such a shame that's he's either forgotten or only remembered for his explicit material. Both of these ignore his truly original contribution to literature. 

He's greatness to me is multifaceted: his social commentary, his personal confession, his philosophical ruminations, his surrealistic free-association, and his poetic language of the human condition. The way Miller effortlessly flows between these styles is truly revelatory. As he states in the epigraph, Tropic of Cancer is the documentation of the truth of a man. The truth may be repugnant, shameful, immoral, etc... but the honesty of the account is what is admirable. It is a difficult task to look at oneself in the mirror and report what looks back. That's the importance of Tropic of Cancer: it is as close to an honest examination of the thoughts, behaviors, and experiences of a person that has ever been recorded.

I would also argue Tropic of Capricorn is the more polished book. Miller's writing is much more cohesive while maintaining his style and frankness. The first paragraph is absolutely devastating and doesn't stop. Capricorn may be the most informative prose about the struggles of the individual becoming an artist. 

These are just my opinions after reading Miller. While he was certainly trying to go up against the taboos of the times, I think that is a very superficial look of what his wiring offers.

I'm interested in what y'all think about him!",books
Sorrows of Influence | The Point Magazine,bil-sabab,,books
So I just read Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions. Masterpiece .,KevinDabstract,"This may just be the best novel of the 20th century.

 Leave it to Vonnegut to be able to take this huge sweeping look at all levels of society in less than 300 pages. Other novelists have tried- Joyce, Dostoevsky, Trollope, Dickens, Tolstoy, Cervantes. And dont get me wrong, they all succeed. But no one succeeds like Vonnegut. No one manages to take this huge look, to perform this amazing task, in less than three hundred pages. All those novels we herald as ""seeing everything""- Brothers Karamazov, Quioxte, Ulysses- they're all cumbersome. Not bad,no, but cumbersome. And yet Vonnegut does everything they do is under 300 pages.

But the wonder of Vonnegut's sweeping vision isn't just one of space, of size. No. Perhaps one of the best things about this book is how Vonnegut seems so connected to it all.  Never does he seem to be above it all. That's a flaw with most other encyclopediac novels. They all seem to put the author ""above"" what they criticize. They're all bad,but not our author. No. He's above that, hes above it all. Vonnegut goes exactly against this. Everything he criticizes, he himself is guilty of. ""When Dwayne Hoover and Kilgore Trout and I were boys"". 

This self critical nature comes to the forefront in what may just be the finest single chapter ever written. Vonnegut himself, writing in first person, finds himself sitting in the same bar as our protagonist, if that can be said here, Dwayne Hoover. And its beautiful. Vonnegut takes the time to reflect on his role as an author. His role as the creator of this universe, the master of all these characters. And he manages to expertly dodge the pitfall of overly pretentious soliloquizing. He's a flawed person, and he sees that. Maybe, he says, he's just a lonely old schizophrenic, sitting in a bar that doesn't exist because he has nowhere real to go. Because he's alone. And all around him, the bar is buzzing with life. Famous painters argue with waitresses, starving parolees eat in the back kitchen, Dwayne himself sits, just as lonely as Vonnegut himself.

There's a lot more going into this book's sheer majesty. But if you've read a Vonnegut novel (except for Slaughterhouse 5. Fuck Slaughterhouse 5) you're used to these elements. The surprising power of his prose, the haunting beauty of his scenes  his tongue in cheek satire, balanced by a thorough sadness, his sheer unwavering truth. Breakfast of Champions has all of these incredible elements, driven into the stratosphere. This is Vonnegut Vonneguting with all his might, and by god is it wonderful. He sees all 9f society, and he doesn't look away. He stares at the world, and the world stares back. But it's the world that blinks. Kurt never does. And looking through his eyes, we see just as much as he does.

According to Vonnegut himself, the point of this book was ""to bring chaos to order"". And by god he does this. There may just be every single element of life in this book. He explains chickens one minute, the holocaust the next. He explains apples, then he explains free will. He sees the entirety of that chaos we called the 20th century. And he reports every inch, every second of it back to us. He reports it better than anyone else ever did

Tldr: he somehow manages to do justice to the entirety of the 20th century in less than 300 pages, and it's one of the greatest literary achievements ever",books

Some questions to people who read just one genre,Wurunzimu,"Disclaimer: I'm not attacking you, mocking you, trying to change you. I just want to understand you because I love reading various types of books and I can't imagine reading just one kind.

1. Is reading only one kind of books your conscious decision or something that just happened?

2. Do you ever get curious about other genres?

3. Have you always had such a strong preference towards one genre or evolved that way with time?

4. Do you plan to try reading other genres in the future or rather keep it the way it is now?

5. Do you think you might be gaining or losing something by reading only one genre?

I personally loved the first FILM which led me to buy and read the book, which I also very much appreciated but honestly I would never have read the book if not for the masterpiece that is the film... Some people have said the graphic novel is ""trash"" and others have described it as Chuck Palahniuk expressing how Fight Club almost hung over his head all these years and he's been unable to get past it somewhat like ""Sebastien"" can't suppress Tyler forever... Others have just outright said it's amazing and people should read it and others have said it tarnishes the original. What I want to know is, does it act as another experimental story which differs from the original, or does it work alongside it nicely, is it Chuck Palahniuk working through his feelings about the first novel, or is it just genuinely a quick cash grab?

Just finished 'The Institute' by Stephen King,Andrew_1304,"This is my first time posting to this subreddit so if this doesn't belong here or isn't ""right"" or something, I'm sorry.

I'm sure it's a pretty general agreement that Stephen King is a great author. And if that's not a general agreement, then, well, I think he's a great author. I just finished his newest release, 'The Institute.' And while I'm not sure what other people think of it, I honestly can say it's probably one of my favorite books.

I can't really explain why I loved this book so much. I guess I just really connected (I feel like that's not really the right word, but it's the closest I can come up with right now) with the characters (mostly the children, although I found myself connecting with Tim and Maureen often as well) and got really invested in them and their situation(s). Nick was definitely the one I connected with the most (that's probably why he's my favorite character), but I also connected a lot to Luke and Avery. All of the characters are just so well-written and believable, from the good guys to the bad guys. They were all so human, and I loved that.

Beyond the characters as a reason for me loving this book, just the idea of this Institute with all these children with psychic abilities in it is really interesting to me in general, and really leaves me thinking, now that the book is over.

Do I even need to mention the writing in general as a reason for loving the book? I probably don't, but there it is. I won't elaborate, I've been going on long enough.

I hope I haven't talked too much, nor wasted your time. If I have, I'm sorry. And I hope this is the right post to make in the right subreddit. Overall, 'The Institute' by Stephen King is an amazing book and I would recommend it to everybody. So, I've briefly shared some of my opinions on the book, if you have read it, what are yours? What did you think of it? I'd love to discuss it with somebody.",books

My grandma, who was my favorite reading buddy, passed away last week and left her pretty large mystery/crime book collection behind. I am morseo of a hard sci-fi/fantasy reader myself but I have always been interested in the genre as we always talk about each others books. I already have a few she recommended me but I was looking for about 5 or 10 more books from this collection. I was wondering if I could get some recommendations from this selection in the album. Like I said I havent really dipped into the genre yet but from other media I've watched I like intense, gritty, complicated plots with twists, or psychological thrillers, things that expose humanity (my favorite sci-fi themes). I would appreciate the help because these are a lot of books and im excited to take the journey she did reading them.",books
Just finished “The Handmaid’s Tale” and I’m both in love with the book and disappointed with the series,SonaSierra19,"! spoiler here !&lt;

So... to be fair, I haven’t watched the show yet. But there is a certain thing that I know is inconsistent with the book, and it’s eating at me slowly. I’ll get to that towards the end of this, but first, I just wanna gush over this book for a bit. 


Goddamn. That was great. That was just so life changing. The simple act of eating an egg or being able to write a single word, or read a word, now has so much worth. You know, people usually bully you about your privilege, or when you complain, they’ll tell you about someone who has it so much worse, how dare you complain, you must just appreciate what you’ve got, in that demanding grandparent voice, and then you just sink into your dissatisfaction more. This book? Yeah, it made me appreciate my privileges because it was so human about them. Goddamn, that writing. T


This is my first Margaret Atwood book and I’m 👌🏽 close to ordering myself all of her books now. It was such an experience, being in Offred’s head and being able to feel what she felt. And the descriptions, the one line when she describes feeling like cotton candy, if squished, a damp pink reddish hardened mass that’ll stick to your hand, I FELT that. I felt all of it. I felt her pain losing Luke and seeing him in Nick, I felt her strange attachment to the Commander that never truly was any feeling or anything she’d dare be real, in any way. I felt her fear of her understanding of Serena, and her joy of finding out Ofglen was on her side. Of mayday. Her memories of the past, the one I’m somewhat a part of. How she described brushing her daughter’s hair in the bath, the smell of shampoo and faint urine, it’s all so real. 



Review’s at that, 10/10, will read again. 


There’s just one little thing I need to get out of my system before I go and watch the series. 


Why is the commander Joseph Fiennes? 



What?



I would pay that man to knock me up, what the fuck? How is he the grey haired, old dude described in the book with a tiny body under his suit and a sad little belly that Offred found laughable? 



Adaptational attractiveness was so unnecessary here. I understand the description was vague, but it was clearly not fuckin “he’s hot, 6’ tall, dark haired well built macho man with a jawline that can slice ice and puppy eyes”. 


Same goes for Serena. Why is she so young? She’s supposed to be older and wrinkled up, yet she looks like a Disney princess in the adaptation. Why? Why would we need that? Why not stay true to the characters and the way they are? 


If it is to make them more likable, I loved the Commander as he was. This old guy, desperate for humanity. It was so human of him to be imperfect, to be unattractive, or average, but nope, he’s Joseph Fiennes. 


And Serena? She was meant to be insecure of her looks, meant to felt older, meant to be jealous and spiteful because of the acknowledgment of inner inferiority she had next to Offred. But nah, she’s drop dead gorgeous, and not a single marking of age on her. The element of weakness she had, despite her power, is gone. She’s no longer a dynamic character, just a consistently domineering queen supreme. 



[I don’t understand, I don’t understand bitch. ](https://youtu.be/UKVIV0EHyQU)

"I only read Sci Fi, Here is what I read in 2019",NaKeepFighting,"Booklist 2019



Gateway- 9/10

Great book! Really dark, it takes a less fantasied view of being a space traveler, I don’t want to say realistic but there is nothing romanticized about anything they do in space, not even the romance, the romance was good in this though, and I hate romance in sci fi, it often feels tacked on, see my next two books, Chasm city more so than house of suns. You learn to be scared of the nothingness here, in other books they will have an evil guy me.evil, try to be menacing, but you go simple, and you go true, who isn’t afraid of that, structure wise he did a great job. The physiatrist unraveling the story while bob hurls insults, iconic. Great book from an icon of sci fi lit, did not disappoint.



House of Suns- 6.7/10

Good concepts, Reynolds really doesn’t have a plan when he writes these books does he? Thought it was ok, think he is very overrated though. This was alright overall, I can’t remember much of what happened and that should say a lot. 



Chasm City 6.3/10 

Finished April 4 2019

Thoughts, Reynolds is more an action writer, like he should stick or action,thriller mystery genre, the ending sucked, main Villain introduced in the final 2 chapters? The other main villain is killed off in the epilogue? 3 love Interests and the choice between them is so random, he just wanted to end the book and had no idea where it was going. I like the flotilla stuff, I really liked Sky Haussmann. Tanner is boring, both of them. Not enough sci fi in my sci fi. I really can’t read another Reynolds book rn, it’s so easy though, his books start strong, narratively so it he has me when I start but when I finish I don’t feel like I read anything, no new concepts or interesting things that stick in my mind, because that’s why I like sci fi, basically for the concepts, and a lot more than that. A good sci fi has to have a good concept, a unique concept, and one of the two, a good narrative, or great characters, Either explore you’re concept on how effects a story or how it effects your story. I did like the structure of the virus taking him back, but he didn’t do anything with it! Biggest narrative blue balls I’ve ever seen, you could have done so much, but you did nothing with it! For shame, I got baited to finishing this book, shoulda stopped halfway through :P



Startide Rising 7.5/10

 finished May 18th 2019

 Dolphins uplifted is a great concept but they just feel like dolphin humans basically, but I can let it go because we have shaped them in our image rather than let evolution shape them. The dolphins are great in this, strong characters on all sides. The book does get better when they are all scattered around on the planet. The politics stuff on the ship does get stale pretty fast. Overall good read. I did want more so I read it’s sequel.



Uplift war 7.8/10

Finished June 12 2019 

Better than it’s predecessors in my opinion, the world is more fleshed out and that’s one of this book’s strength it’s world building. A lot more action than sci fi, but it’s not as bad as Reynolds, because he’s got great characters and their is a sufficient sci fi “ flavoring” to make this go down easy. The Suzerains are such great sci fi ”villains”, I say villains because the don’t feel villainy in that tacky way (see Reynolds), you actually can relate with them and through half the book I was empathetic for The Suzerain of Propriety. Uplift is such an interesting topic to me right now, and while some of this book was directly about that in parts, I wish he could have done more with it, I have an uplift itch to scratch.



Children of Ruin 9/10

Finished June 28 2019 5:49 am

This scratched my uplift itch just in the right spot.Really loved the original book, this sequel does not disappoint. This book does have a different tone, and has some terrifying imagery in places that really stuck with me. with the twist on the classic hive mind, a lot of new ideas and concepts it has been one of my favorite books I’ve read recently. I’ve been reading a lot of uplift books recently but the difference here and the “Uplift Original trilogy”

Is that these uplifted animals feel uniquely alien and in a realistic way while in the uplift trilogy they are just animal versions of humans. Definitely would recommend.

"The Masterpiece That Is Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment""",ThatOneNerdBoy,"A book review from me is long overdue, but I haven't had the time to write analyses of the books I've been reading. I will write and post a review for ""1984"" by George Orwell soon after I post this. Also, please keep in mind that ***I have only read ""Crime and Punishment"" once and, as such, I probably have not grasped all that this book has to offer.***

  
Raskolnikov is a destitute student who was forced to drop out of law school because he could not afford his tuition. Unable to pay his rent, he is on the brink of getting evicted from his apartment. After some contemplation, he decides to murder a corrupt pawnbroker and take her money. The rationale behind this decision is quite naive: Raskolnikov needs money and the pawnbroker is a bad person. The choice seems juvenile since these reasons should not warrant *murdering a human being with an axe*.

Either way, Raskolnikov follows through with it. He ends up also murdering the pawnbroker's sister, an innocent, abused woman. The mental stress and self-reproach that ensue in Raskolnikov's mind are quite extreme. Raskolnikov is deeply disturbed by the fact that he is unable to keep a cool head after the double homicide. You see, Raskolnikov believed in an interesting philosophy of the separation of humans into two different categories, ""ordinary"" and ""extraordinary"". When ""extraordinary"" people work toward higher causes, laws do not apply to them in their heads. Raskolnikov is unsettled by the fact that he is not an ""extraordinary"" person.

In the end, Raskolnikov, unable to cope with the mental repercussions of what he has done, turns himself in. He is exiled to Siberia, where the story ends on a positive note. Raskolnikov embraces the reality of his human nature. He is only an ""ordinary"" man, with emotions and a moral compass. Dostoevsky's novel is a beautiful depiction of the duality of the human condition. A seemingly normal introvert and otherwise mentally stable man does something radically immoral. The book shows us that we should accept our humanity, emotions, and the fact that we, like Raskolnikov, sometimes make stupid decisions.

On a side note, the subplot of the book is also quite nice. Raskolnikov's sister engages with a wealthy man to bring financial stability to the family. Raskolnikov realizes the true intention behind the marriage and refuses to allow his sister to sacrifice herself for him. The man Raskolnikov's sister was to marry is a man who is the perfect caricature of hypocrisy and pride. Furthermore, Raskolnikov helps with the funeral process of a man he was acquainted with, Marmeladov, who Raskolnikov witnessed die in a road accident. These events further demonstrate that Raskolnikov is only human, with both positive and negative sides.

***I rate this book a 5/5.*** From the plot to the moral implications to the marvelous crafting of the underbelly of St. Petersburg, where the story takes place, this story is a ***MASTERPIECE***. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of beautiful novels with a philosophical meaning behind them.

Thanks for reading all of that! Leave comments and let me know what you thought. I hope you look forward to my review of ""1984"" by George Orwell. Have a nice day!",books

"After finishing It by Stephen King, I just ordered my first e-reader!",redrosereverie,"It took me very long to read this very long book, like over 6 months of small sessions in bed. What I noticed is that sometimes I was reading quite slowly and that my eyes hurt a ton.

I am a computer science student so I already spend the majority of the day staring at a screen. While reading It I rediscovered just how much I love reading, I find it an absolutely wonderful experience and can't get enough of it. I used to read a lot more a few years ago but my reading kind of well off in favor of playing games and watching things. 

I was excited the whole time while reading It to be done and to move on to reading shorter books and more books because I love experiencing the fictional worlds, situations and ideas in books. It was a nice book but after about 800 pages I started realizing ""Wow! There are so many other highly recommended books that are just 400 pages long!"" and got very excited at the prospect of reading other books afterwards and experiencing wildly different things.

I just ordered  my first e-ink reader because I read that people who bought these had a wonderful, eyestrainless experience and that it's like reading on paper. ""It"" was the first ebook I read and it was all on my phone late at night in bed. So the eyestrain was a huge problem sometimes. I love reading on paper but what I find annoying is that I can't really read on my back with the book held up because it's too heavy for me and the pages always flip over. Books are also more expensive and if you want a physical book you have to go out and get it or wait for it to arrive.

It was a bit of an impulse purchase but I'm very excited to receive my ereader in 2 days and see what the e-ink experience is like. If I don't find it that much better than my phone I have 30 days to return it so I'm not too worried about not liking it.

I'm not sure what the point of this post was, I guess I am just excited at rediscovering my love for reading and at the prospect of reading many more books after getting through this insanely long book, and I wanted to share my thoughts.",books

So I’ve mainly read fiction/biographies but never a self help book. 

I might come across really stupid in this so please don’t judge me lol. 

I’m reading a book called ‘how to break up with your phone’. 

There is a 30 day plan and each day has its own instruction.  How would you approach this book?

Would you read Monday instructions on Monday’s, the Tuesday instructions on Tuesday etc. 

Or would you carry on reading the whole thing and make notes? 

Thanks",books

Just finished reading Blood Meridian for the first time in a long while and it’s not as good as I remembered,goyourownwaymaybe,"I might get ripped apart for this. I know McCarthy is regarded as one of the American (all time?) greats and I really do remember enjoying this the first time I read it.

What changed?

Maybe someone can help me — why is this book so highly regarded? Most of the reviews I’ve read about this (and McCarthy) in general are nothing but praise. I even saw one review that seemed to say that this book HAD to be good because it was studied in one of the better colleges over in the United States.

It was OK, sure; it was violent and it did what I think it set out to do, but that’s scraping the bottom of the barrel. I could throw together a series of events and claim to have put out a literary masterpiece. The formula of the plot (what plot?) seems to be very much join posse, ride through the desert, hit a town, drink and cause trouble, ride out, murder innocents, hit another town, repeat.

That probably wouldn’t be so bad if there were actual characters to help pull the story along, I suppose. Just one character with a bit of substance — just one.

What’s that? “But the Judge!” I hear you say. Oh, you mean that one character that is probably the most ham-handed, two-dimensional, coulda-been-written-by-a-15 year old antagonist? Yeah... no. Why is he a good character? He doesn’t do anything. I’m sure there’s probably supposed to be some deep meaning behind him and that his actions and motives are supposed to be some dark reflection of humanity, yadda yadda... he sucks.

“Oh but what about Glanton!” you might shout. Glanton who? Must have forgotten about him.

“Toadvine!” you call. Was he the one who rode the horse or the one with the hat? Now that you mention it... didn’t they all do that?

I powered on through this because I felt like I had to. Truthfully, I probably could have closed the book around 80 pages in and have finished the story.",books

Haruki Murakami,naokomiyano,"I've read many Murakami books in my life , partly due to my parents love for him (hence my name) . And I absolutely love him and his work . 

For a literature class at uni , we had to read Kafka on the Shore , I was happy bc my friends could finally experience a Murakami novel . After reading it they hated it mostly , and thought Murakami was a creep of a guy . They thought this because of the nature of Miss Saeki's (55 years old or so) relationship with Kafka (who was 15) . I see where they're coming from , but I also think that is just part of him getting his literary point (theme) across . He's done things like this in his other books , but it never seems to be all that out of place .

FlashForward...is the book much like the tv show?,RubiRenee,"I just finished watching the (sadly) only season made of the tv show called FlashForward which was an adaptation of the book by the same name by Robert J. Sawyer. For the life of me, I can't even begin to understand how they could have canceled the show, it was SO good! Seriously, what I wouldn't give to have even just one more season. Excellent cast and storylines. As you can tell, I really enjoyed the show and I've been debating on whether or not I should read the book. How closely did the show follow the book? Are the characters the same? I was kind of hoping the book would be excellent but not too much like the show because these characters are pretty special to me know, I don't want my feelings for them tainted by the book. Also, the show ended with a cliffhanger (and WOW what a hanger!) because they filmed it before they knew the show hadn't been renewed and obviously the book doesn't end hanging from a cliff. I'll get closure with the book I didn't get with the show, if I decide to read it. Just not sure if it will be a good closure.

Anyway, I really fell in love with the characters...well, most of them, and I don't want the book to ruin that for me, if you know what I mean. I guess I'm just curious as to what people who have both seen the show and read the book have to say about this. All opinions are welcome.",books
Does anyone recognise which book this might be? (Horror anthology),0n_th3_w4y,"Hi everyone,

I've remembered some details of a scary book I read in high school, and am itching to figure out which book it was! It may be too long a shot, as it was a book I borrowed from my school library (UK) about 8 years ago.

I think the book was an anthology of shorter horror stories, similar to ""Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark"". The only story I can remember from the book is about two teenage boys who befriend a mysterious girl in their school/town.

Each time the boys see the girl, she is wearing a different t-shirt with a strange question or ominous phrase on it that she never explains to them. The girl starts to play the two boys against each other as they fight for her favour, and she dares them to complete different tasks to prove their courage over each other. The only detail I can remember about the book is that the trio end up at a sort of landfill or construction site, with one teen boy eventually getting trapped in a safe that gets buried, or covered with cement. I think the story has some sort of scary ending about the remaining boy seeing a hand sticking out of the cement, creepy stuff.

So, does this sound familiar to anyone? Thanks in advance for any suggestions",books

What's your opinion on the current state of the book market?,readernugged,"Reading the current best-sellers in the New York Times, I've noticed that in the fiction section there isn't much variety. As of February 2, 2020, 8 of the 15 books are murder/mystery/thriller novels, and, from the ones that aren't, three of them were written by three writers that have been well-established in the market for a long time now (Danielle Steel, Andrzej Sapkowski and Ann Patchett), and another was ""Little Fires Everywhere"", which has been there for months. 

It seems to me that everything is quite monotonous now, although it has improved drastically since the Harry Potter days (though Harry Potter still is more popular than the vast majority of books, including those written by well-known authors). Of course, I do think people should read whatever they want, but, from my personal point of view, I'd like to see more variety.

Just Finished All Quiet On The Western Front,waldoaldom20,"A lot of hype on this book, albeit being almost 90 years old. My edition had a banner on the cover claiming *All Quiet On The Western Front* to be the ""Greatest War Novel of All Time."" Well, they might be right. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have yet to read another book that provides such a harrowing depiction of war. The totality of the experience, the surges between hopelessness and will to live, the nearly unbelievable levels of violence, it all combines into a gripping, if terribly sad, story. 

&amp;nbsp;

To a ""t,"" *All Quiet On The Western Front* gives a depiction of the ""Lost Generation,"" the generation of soldiers whose bodies survived the war, but whose minds and attitudes were forever changed. The only heroism in the book comes from the comradery between friends, and the will to survive the horrors of the front. They don't fight for glory, honor, or country; they fight to survive.

&amp;nbsp;

Perhaps most interesting, for me, was the interactions the protagonist, Paul Bäumer, has with civilians. They cannot understand his and the other soldiers' sufferings, and he cannot express them in full anyways even if he wanted to. There is a disconnect between those doing the fighting and those who are not, which alienates Bäumer. It reminds me that soldiers still experience this today. That the alienation some veterans feel is not a new experience, and that as a society, we are burdened not only with finding a way to cure the symptoms of war, but finding a way to cure the cause as well, which is pointless, destructive, inhuman war.

"Just finished Ta-Nehisi Coates' ""The Water Dancer""",flyinghippo42,"It is too early after reading his novel for me to realize and communicate all the symbolism interwoven into his story, but Mr. Coates took me along for an incredible journey.

Something about his writing is so clear in ""The Water Dancer"", which is largely about  the  power of memories, as the author himself seems to be pulling me with his own story of conduction. I had previously read Coates' run on ""The Black Panther"" and his way of sewing a storyline together is as prevalent there as it is within this novel. Yet I think within the pages of this novel, something more than a fiction was told.  A memory felted imparted on me. The details of Hiram's feelings towards stories, and tales, course through Coates' writing into my own physical senses.

Though I cried far less than how necessary it seems to do so with the sad subjects told, I'm left chilled and a somewhat ""high"" after finishing.

I'm no author in my own right, so I cannot profess a call to action worthy enough, or to the level that Mr. Coates might, to read this book, but I insist that your time will be not wasted in picking his work up.

Percy Jackson deserved as much recognition and love as Harry Potter,Razik_,"Despite loving Harry Potter and Percy Jackson equally I can't help but think about how underrated the Percy Jackson universe is in comparison to Harry Potter.

Percy Jackson had all the elements to be a universally loved series from its educational aspect on Greek Mythology to ride-or-die characters that you just can't get enough of. Not to mention the exciting quests, adventures and monsters. 

Though this series has an amazing fanbase led by Uncle Rick at the helm, I would've loved for it to have a cultural imprint on pop culture. Which brings me to my next point: the movies.

Most of what solidified Harry Potter into a worldwide phenomenon was the films that were perfectly executed and revered by the public. Sadly, Percy Jackson did not have this boost as the movies that were produced were less than satisfactory and deviated heavily from the source material. Also much of why the films failed to hit the mark was the casting of adult actors which did not match with the original ages of the characters, thus not balancing out with the audience of the film.

In conclusion I would like to say that I feel Percy Jackson could've been on the same level as Harry Potter and I just hope Rick Riordan wins the battles he is currently fighting on adapting Percy Jackson into a tv show.",books

What is the coolest book have you ever owned?,Noir888,"Either in physical copy or in ebook form, and tell the reason why you consider it as the coolest book that you have in your collection.

Mine is The Book of Abramelin (also known in its longer name as The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage), I consider it the coolest book in my collection because of its mysterious background.

The Book of Abramelin tells the story of an Egyptian mage named Abramelin, who taught a system of magic to Abraham of Worms, a jew from Worms, Germany. The books is a prime example of a Grimoire (A Grimoire is a textbook of magic, typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits, deities, and demons.)

The book is framed as a sort of epistolary novel or autobiography in which Abraham of Worms describes his journey from Germany to Egypt and reveals Abramelin's magical and Kabbalistic secrets to his son Lamech. Internally the text dates itself to the year 1458.

The story involves Abraham of Worms passing his magical and Kabbalistic secrets on to his son and tells how he acquired his knowledge. Abraham recounts how he found Abramelin the Mage living in the desert outside an Egyptian town, Arachi or Araki, which borders the Nile. Abramelin's home sat atop a small hill surrounded by trees. He was an Egyptian mage and taught a powerful form of Kabbalistic magic to Abraham. He was a ""venerable aged man"", and very courteous and kind. He discussed nothing but ""the Fear of God"", the importance of leading a well-regulated life, and the evils of the ""acquisition of riches and goods"".

Abramelin extracted a promise from Abraham that he would give up his ""false dogmas"" and live ""in the Way and Law of the Lord."" He then gave Abraham two manuscript books to copy for himself, asking for ten gold florins which he took with the intention of distributing to seventy-two poor persons in Arachi. Upon his return fifteen days later, after having disposed of the payment money, Abramelin extracted an oath from Abraham to ""serve and fear"" the Lord, and to ""live and die in His most Holy Law."" After this, Abramelin gave Abraham the ""Divine Science"" and ""True Magic"" embedded within the two manuscripts, which he was to follow and give to only those whom he knew well.

There are four sections within the book, the first book tells the story of Abraham's travel to Egypt and his subsequent encounter with the Mage, and details the magic that Abramelin taught to Abraham and the latter's instructions to Lamech in safeguarding the magical knowledge that he has inherited, the next 3 books contains the actual magical operations that was discussed in the first book.

The text describes an elaborate ritual whose purpose is to obtain the ""knowledge and conversation"" of the magician's ""guardian angel."" The preparations are elaborate, difficult, and long. All of the German texts describe a duration for the operation of 18 months before any divine contact is known. In the Mathers translation, the initial phase of working the system lasts only six months.

During the period of the work, the magician must daily pray before sunrise and again at sunset. During this preparatory phase, there are many restrictions: chastity must be observed, alcoholic beverages refused, and the magician must conduct his business with scrupulous fairness.

After the preparatory phase has been successfully completed, the magician's Holy Guardian Angel will appear and reveal magical secrets.

Once this is accomplished, the magician must evoke the 12 Kings and Dukes of Hell (Lucifer, Satan, Leviathan, Belial, etc.) and bind them. Thereby, the magician gains command of them in his own mental universe and removes their negative influence from his life. Further, these spirits must deliver a number of familiar spirits (four principal familiars, and several more associated with a set of magical word-square talismans provided in the Abramelin's Book Four).

The magical goals for which the demons can be employed are typical of those found in grimoires: the practitioner is promised the ability to find buried treasure, cast love charms, the ability of magical flight, and the secret of invisibility, to list a small number of examples.

Magic squares feature prominently in the instructions for carrying out these operations, as does a recipe for an anointing oil (taken from Exodus 30), popularly used by ceremonial magicians under the name ""Abramelin Oil"". There are also several further tools - such as a holy Lamp, a Wand made of an almond branch, a recipe for incense known today as ""Abramelin Incense"" (also taken from Exodus 30), various Robes, a square or seven-sided plate of silver or (bees) wax, etc.

Because the work involves evocation of demons, the Abramelin operation has been compared to Goetic magic, especially by European scholars. However, the text's primary focus is upon the invocation of the guardian angel, and modern works on the subject tend to focus upon this aspect as well.

The practical magic of Abramelin (found in both Book III of the French text, and Book IV of the German original) centers around a set of talismans composed of magic word squares. These are similar to traditional magic squares, though the latter are usually composed of numbers, while Abramelin's squares contain letters. Commonly word squares are used as puzzles or as teaching aids for students. In the context of Abramelin, the focus becomes mystical—so that each square should contain words or names that relate to the magical goal of the square. A parallel is found in the famous Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas word square, an altered version of which is also found among Abramelin's squares.

For example, a square entitled ""To walk underwater for as long as you want"" contains the word MAIAM (מים), the Hebrew word for ""water"". A square for recovering treasures of jewelry begins with the word TIPHARAH (תפארה, a variant of Tiferet), which can mean ""golden ring"" in Hebrew and is also the name of the sphere of ""Beauty"" (which has the planetary attribution of the Sun) on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.

The system of magic from the book regained popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries partly due to Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers' translation, The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage; and partly to its importance within the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and later within the mystical system of Thelema (created in 1904 by Aleister Crowley).

Due to trust issues, Mathers used the least-reliable manuscript copy as the basis for his translation, and it contains many errors and omissions. The later English translation (The copy that I own) by Georg Dehn and Steven Guth, based on the earliest and most complete sources, is more scholarly and comprehensive. Dehn attributed authorship of The Book of Abramelin to Rabbi Yaakov Moelin, a German Jewish Talmudist. This identification has since been disputed.",books

Nico and his ""Pa"" (father) have to navigate the resulting wasteland that South Africa became.

"Just finished my first H Rider Haggard’s book, King Solomon’s Mines, and it was a great read, addictive and entertaining.",DunBanner,"H Rider Haggard is a writer, whose works I’ve wanted to try for quite some time as he was an influence on two of my favourite writers, Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E Howard, and since his famous work King Solomon’s Mines, is considered one of the seminal works of adventure fiction, I’d figured I’ll try the book from my college library, and see if it holds up and I’m happy to report that it does, it has its flaws but if you’re looking to read an entertaining book, King Solomon’s Mines has an adventure of the ages that’ll simply sweep you of your feet and refuse to let go until the final chapter. 
Nevertheless, there are two main issues with the book. As it is written at the height of the British Empire, the racism is heavy in it and I’ll be honest, I’ve struggled with the initial chapters due to its imperialistic tone, even though I guess, this line of thought was common for the time. The other issue, is the trophy hunting, which was popular among the British adventurers, and the many shahs, emirs, sultans, and kings of the time, as in one chapter the characters, hunt a herd of wild elephants just because they can, and while it is vividly written and filled with tense action, some readers might find the book uncomfortable due to the above points. 
Although, if you’re able to get past the issues, then the book offers a ride unlike any other. Our hero is Allan Quatermain, trader, hunter, adventurer, and in his own words, a timid cautious man, who gets recruited for an expedition by Henry Curtis, who is looking for his missing brother, presumed missing after he went looking for the mythical Solomon’s Mines, located in the heart of Africa. The plot might sound generic to modern reader due to exposure to popular adventure franchises like Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, and Uncharted but the beauty of the story is the imaginative perils that Haggard throws at his heroes that varied, and always keeps a sense of excitement for the reader to discover. 
The characters likewise, are colourfully described, Allan Quatermain is a sly grizzled hero (a Goodreads review described him as a grizzled Odysseus, and it perfectly fits his character), the stoic Sir Henry, the jovial captain Good, and Umbopa a Zulu warrior who joins the expedition for his own reasons. I have say though, despite the racism and sexism, Haggard portrays a believable picture of African tribal warfare and politics (largely drawn from his own personal experiences), his African characters aren’t dumb or stupid, and Umbopa actually has a fully realized character arc in the story. 
The writing likewise, is great, simple and to the point, and keeps the pace of the adventure story going without slowing it down. Haggard is also capable of poetic prose, especially in final third of the book as action reaches a crescendo, and the characters break into war songs, and battle cries. I was literally reading aloud the final chapters of the book, it was that good. 
All in all, King Solomon’s Mines is the Grand Old Man of exotic adventure stories, and I’ve firmly booked my seat on H Rider Haggard’s hype train. If you try this book and liked it, I strongly suggest following the chronological order of Allan Quatermain’s adventures, as given in Wikipedia because according to Haggard’s fans, Allan Quatermain, the final book series, focuses heavily on the character, and his past adventures, and gives an emotional farewell to the hero, even though all the books in the series are standalone in nature. 
Other good books written by Haggard, which are generally recommended as starting points are: The Brethren (HRH considered this book, his personal favourite), The Wanderer’s Necklace, Eric Brighteyes (Viking story in the style of Norse sagas), and The People of the Mist. The man was incredibly prolific (58 novels), so there’s a lot to choose from.",books

Back when books and new types of printers were being made, all the way from the 1400s to before modern printers were made, how in the world were the books mass produced in enough time to have enough books be passed out into the world? Im asking how were the print houses able to distribute them as fast as they did? Back then, they were very beautiful and hand crafted, mostly with leather hard covers.

Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë,Titouf19,"DAE feel like a masochist for enjoying this book? All the characters are either in pain or inflicting pain, and when you think things might turn out ok they don't. I felt more irritated and depressed after each chapter. As the story progressed, it just buried itself in more complicated and toxic relationship development, and the characters either slowly die or get more corrupted by their inner demons. The ending was kind of cute, but only because everything that came before was so dispiriting.

But despite all this I would probably read it again?! Since the characters and environment were so well fleshed out, all of it seemed inevitable. Catherine, Hareton, Isabella, Heathcliff, ... They're just emotional messes that end up feeling very human. It's a tragic story but awe-inspiring in its honesty.

Would definitely recommend this book to anyone whose life is going a bit too well and wants to feel miserable. :')",books

"I just read ""The gambler"", written by Dostoevsky",Ihatereddit20025,"I'm currently thinking at the sensations which a gambler has to try until he wins or loses, until he runs out the money or he becomes rich. I realised that  his hopes are the result of an antecedent win or lose, because he wants to recuperate his money, if he lost or he wants to increase his wins with a bigger sum of money. 
 The psychological parts of this novel is impressive, even more because he wrote this novel in 19th century, when the roulette and the betting games was at the beginning. So, he had had to understand the principle after his experiences, because he was a gambler. 
  The novel is notable too because he was written in 3  weeks due to his need for money, but the most important thing is that you don't feel the sensation that it's a novel quickly written, because it's elaborated, even if it has 190 pages.

Just finished reading Mountains of Madness,BeachSamurai,"Damn, the use of adjectives in this book is awe inspiring.

`There now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose needle pointed heights loomed dream-like against the beckoning rose-colour of the western sky.`

Thats double digit adjectives in one sentence *s'il vous plait* (please in french). 

I got a few questions concerning the story though:

1) At the end of the book they speak of the carvings on the tunnel walls becoming crude unlike the carvings in the beginnings, were these carvings done by the Shoggoths as an imitation to their Masters? 

2) Why did the Shoggoths satisfy themselves with eating the heads of their masters? 

3) Does Danforth see Cthulu? did he have a hand in the destruction of the old ones? 

4) Why did the professor feel that the old ones were heroes all of sudden? He forgot they killed and massacred his crew? 

1 Hole I feel is in the story, its about the evolution of the beings. 

I feel that the shoggoths and the cthulu beings were the only 2 too evolve. I mean How can you become more intelligent than your Master just doing daily tasks and imitating that person who is not even teaching you stuff. That does not make sense.

So if this is not a hole it feels like the Old ones were on earth on an extended holiday, like when you go to some foreign country on your vacation and party so much your body gets out of shape, and your mind is dull and blunt from unwinding. Is that what happened?",books

Georges Politzer's Elementary Principles of Philosophy is the best introduction to Philosophy,KnowledgeCastle,"Short description: a complicated book for a beginner and at the same time the best book to start with.

I was only 15 years old when I read Georges Politzer's Elementary Principles of Philosophy and finished it in 2 days. 

I was studying Philosophy (as a Mathematics student) at high school for the first month, and I remember when my teacher noticed my curiosity and offered me the book to read it.

Imagine reading G. Politzer at the age of 15, when the only thing you know about philosophy are some random names such as: Socrates, Plato, Greece. And that's it! Any other word is for you a new world you never imagined it existed before.

The first pages were very hard to understand. I used to quit reading anything I can't understand at the time, but this book was different. It was full of examples, mind blowing questions, real life situations and I just felt so overwhelmed by everything that I decided to finish the book, no matter what happens.

After 48h, I returned the book to my teacher with 2 papers full of texts I've written as notes and answers. 

Since that day I felt like I was no longer 15 year old. It made me grow up by a couple of years in few hours.

House by Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker is an amazing read,faueth_hanna,"Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker have a very underrated thriller titled House. If you love mystery, thrillers, or perhaps even a book that messes with your mind, you should read it. If recommend it to anyone! So beware for spoilers and please read before selecting this thread.

  Now, I have no clue if the book has been discussed yet, but it needs to be. If you have read it, I would appreciate your input on it. If you are reading this thread without reading House, let me summarize it for you-as i have read it at least eight times.

  House opens up through the point of view of Jack a, presumably, mid-twenties man on the way to a marriage counselor with wife stephanie. While Jack is not given too much description, he fully describes Stephanie as ""blond, youthful, a real credit to those jeans- everything the guys in lounges and bars could want in a country singer"".  However their plans for counseling are cut short by a flirty and rude state trooper, ""faster"" routes, and a backwoods spike trap. Stranded in the middle of nowhere Alabama, USA, they walk looking for assistance or preferably a phone. They come across the WAYSIDE INN, a big nice home in the middle of the woods. Walking inside they meet Leslie and Randy another struggling couple who were stranded in the middle of nowhere. Together these two couples are about to go through the night of there lives consisting of a sick game, sacrifice, and a macabre madman called Barsidious White. The rest of the story is up for you to read.

Atlas Shrugged made me think about the world of today's politics,hugaddiction,"The underlying theme of this story that I found most profound was its ability to describe a modern struggle between good and evil. 

54 years after this book was written, the ideas that it expounds upon are the same as ideas that are  battling for your beliefs in 2020.  These ideas are at war for you support and  loyalty via your politicians, news organizations, cultural icons, as well as from your neighbors and peers. Those around you will seek validation for their own beliefs, or to label you as a threat to those ideas, which can result in you being silenced and shamed, no matter whether you are right or wrong.  

I believe that it is our responsibility as humans as we go through life to not only identify acts of evil, but the ideas that birthed those actions and also label them as evil.  For example this Marx dictate as referenced in the book, ""**From each** according to **his ability, to each** according to **his** needs"" sounds progressive when you reference your feelings of generosity and kindness toward your fellow man, but in action this idea takes from those who produce and gives to those who produce nothing, which is plainly unjust and therefore evil.

As it is relevant to my life today, I see people look past these old Marxist ideas as if they are harmless, spouting them off as political rhetoric like the ideas were their own, and not those of long dead socialist of the 19th and 20th century. The new packaging on old ideas has the same intent and the same anti human nature as its means to its ends.  One example I see this in is from american politicians stoking class struggle as if we remember nothing of Russia's starvation of starvation of Ukraine and the blood shed that followed the ""wealth redistribution"" at the birth of the Soviet Union.

I know tge last two are good books. I live their writing style, the complex characters. So why do I find myself being so bored and disengaged?

Same thing happened to me with Leo Carews The Spider, or Newmans The Ruthless, the feeling that the sequel won't be as good as the first. I'm lucky if I go through a chapter of the Bitter Twins.

Notes on the New Latin American Weird,sombrasambulantes,"The weird as affect and modality emerges every time we confront, whether directly or indirectly, those situations that effectively exist yet should not exist: situations such as extreme poverty, homelessness, hunger, senseless violence artificially caused by private property, the division of labor and rampant exploitation. The cultural critic Mark Fisher categorizes the weird as “affect, but also as mode: mode of film and fiction, mode of perception, and ultimately, mode of being.” Within the context of Latin American reality, the experience and representation of the weird diverge from yet are similar to those in Britain described by Fisher. It isn’t surprising that Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón was able to capture the essence of everyday life in Britain in Children of Men: the eerie dystopian nature of contemporary capitalism, marked by war, poverty, and social decay, as portrayed by Cuarón, is not a situation particular to any one nation state, rather it is our shared global condition at the turn of the century.

It is a fact that around the world, in the global nation that is called Capitalism as film director Bong Joon-Ho recently stated, violence underlies the daily life of the working poor, farmers, factory workers, social reproduction workers, and all the other social layers of the dispossessed, those that own nothing but their bodies, their capacity to work. Take for instance Mexico’s narco-military ‘alliance of progress’ that has turned cities and towns into battle fields of a seemingly never ending war, or the exponential rise in homelessness that has become more and more visible in metropolitan centers around the continent, or the condition of indigenous people throughout Latin America akin to those faced under colonial rule. When confronted with such situations, we feel uneasy, we question what lies behind such horrors: are they the consequence of our human nature, or megalomaniac leaders, or a primal death drive, or is it something that can be eliminated? Such visible examples of the social horrors caused by capitalist social relations can sometimes hide the invisible horrors that the majority has to endure for the accumulation of capital to continue without interruption, without regard for human life or natural ecosystems, as if an alien life force had taken control of society and organized it in their interests.

This is the main contradiction that the weird aims to problematize: the prevalence of extreme, or barbaric, forms of poverty amongst the most advanced technological development ever seen by humanity, objectively capable of eradicating poverty and elevating humanities standard and quality of life. As Fisher writers, “the form that is perhaps most appropriate to the weird is montage: the conjoining of two or more things which do not belong together.”

What I want to call the New Latin American Weird – an aesthetic sensibility that cuts across literature, film, music, and painting – deals with the history, politics, culture, and identity of Latin America by exposing and questioning and problematizing both the visible and invisible horrors the workers and dispossessed in Latin America have been condemned to by the imperialist centers and their own national lumpen-bourgeoisies. Thus, the new weird tendency denotes an attempt to broaden our view and understanding of the inner functioning of the world in which we live, a world full of weird situations that are hard to accept when confronted by it whether face to face, through literature, or another medium. In a continent like Latin America, where violence, death, and phantasmagoric imaginaries have long histories, these realities are rooted in the fabric and experience of everyday life amongst the oppressed who endure the negative side effects, or consequences, of the dialectic of capitalist progress.

The tendency towards the weird grew significantly in what we could call Latin American literature, that is literature written by both provincial and cosmopolitan Latin American writers, during the 1990s as a response or a challenge to the narrative of the end of history and the end of political and cultural rebellion that it promoted. The New Latin American Weird is the synthesis of three critical movements/historical moments: gothic, noir, and modernism. From modernism they employ the imperative to experiment and challenge literary, ideological, and political conventions. Despite borrowing from avant-garde aesthetics, these artists have thus far been unable to develop a practical revolutionary politics which were essential to the avant-garde, an impotence that can be explained by the waning of class struggle that has prevailed since the global (temporary) defeats of 1968, the anti-colonial movements and revolutions of the global south, and the civil rights movement in the U.S. The battlefield for these writers, for this literary and aesthetic tendency, became that of language and ideology, and their battle cry became the defense of radical imaginaries and critical world views that challenge the monolithic political views and socio-cultural experiences of the world under capitalism, where the workday never seems to end and the money doesn’t afford us any new or interesting experiences.

Some of the artists and works in this tendency are Yuri Herrera’s Signs Preceding the End of the World, Gabriela Alemán’s Poso Wells, Roberto Bolaño’s By Night in Chile or 2666, Mariana Enriquez' Things we Lost in the Fire, and Amat Escalante’s films Heli and The Untamed.",books

On A Little Life,nigelhervey,"Jude has encountered brutal pain in his life. But I believe he could have gained dominion over his demons. Harsh? Yes, but what could he have done better than becoming whole with himself? And I think because he doesn’t come to terms with his life, it haunts him. And not coming to terms produces the pain of his adulthood. He misses a perfect opportunity when Harold and Julia adopt him and Willem starts a relationship with him. It was the ideal time to confide his upbringing, but he can’t. Brother Luke and Dr. Traylor create the pain of his childhood, but the tyranny of mental illness carries his pain into adulthood. He doesn’t have to let it happen. 

To clarify, Jude’s problems — cutting, suicidal thoughts, lack of intimacy — originate from childhood and are not his fault. They’re extremely difficult problems to burden. It’s no surprise Jude struggled the way he did. However, I think it’s unfortunate he spent much of his life dwelling when he had opportunities to act vulnerable and open to people who loved him.

Jude holds responsibility for the unnecessary pain in his adulthood. For example, sabotaging his health despite Andy’s support, not communicating with his therapist and him starving himself. When Willem died, Jude broke. His death killed Jude, but it didn’t have to. I really believe even the smallest act of openness could have given him the tool to become stronger and more resilient. I feel for Jude as does everybody else. There’s much to learn from his character.",books

Second Fiddle Prisoners: Jennifer Egan's The Keep,Isz82,"I have a soft spot for metafiction.  Also horror.  With that in mind, I decided to purchase and read Jennifer Egan's 2006 best seller, The Keep.  

This is a weird one for me.  This is a very satisfying read.  Borrowing from gothic tropes, it begins with a man named Danny (later described as wearing makeup, bringing the ""gothic"" theme full circle) visiting his cousin Howie/Howard, who has purchased a castle in some unknown central European country.  

The novel quickly breaks by disclosing that this story is ""fiction"" being written by a prisoner in a creative writing class, Ray.  Ray is in prison for an unknown crime, but given the nature of his fellow prisoners' crimes, it has to be a pretty bad one.  

I took my time with this novel because I really enjoyed it, and the way that it plays with the two narratives and its themes.  And then came the twist, which I was not expecting at all.  The twist has forced me to go back and re-read some of what was written before.  Because, like good metafiction, the twist inverts the entire novel.  Suddenly, the POV is not what you thought it was, even in that odd context I described.  Suddenly, you have to re-evaluate everything that was being written, and why it was being written.  

I keep thinking about what a great book this was the more that I think of it.  I'm curious to hear everyone else's thoughts.",books

A Brave New World - Happiness Vs. Pleasure,squench2000,"So, I have wanted to read A Brave New World for many years, but I honestly sort of forgot about its existence until I stumbled upon a copy of it in a thrift store (EXCELLENT place to pick up books, my friends). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished it last night, and I must say, it wasn't the easiest read ever for me. Some things were hard to follow and the story itself didn't really pull me in; I would, at times, force myself to read on, rather than be excited to continue. This being said about the story itself, I did really enjoy the themes of the book and some of the questions it provoked inside of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

One big one that I've been thinking about today is the line between pleasure and happiness. Where I'm from (North America), I feel like materialism, production, social media, and frankly, just the zeitgeist, has people confused about what happiness really is. The dramatically production-based society in A Brave New World really helped me to see this in a full light, as I myself, often am blind to the contrasts of pleasure and happiness. 

  
The reality is, happiness and pleasure are two different things, but people regularly mistake pleasure for happiness. Pleasure is right now. Pleasure is instant gratification, for the most part. Seeking pleasure is seeking short-term thrills, which will not necessarily carry over through time. In the novel, everything in their society is pleasure based, although they refer to it amongst themselves as happiness, ‘everyone’s happy now’, they say, when in reality, all these things making the people ‘happy’, are short-lived pleasures, like sex, games, superficial vacations, etc., and whenever they feel discontent inside of them, there’s old faithful soma to keep the illusion turning.

  
This is very common in modern society, too, as materialism and capitalism becomes more and more entrenched in our daily lives, and especially with the impact of social media distorting people’s views on self-image, and messing with their reward systems. Happiness is not something you seek out, it’s not tangible, there is no ‘key to happiness’, as far as I’m concerned. It is more of a state of mind, a state of well-being. I gain happiness from simple things, reading and finishing a book, completing chores I’ve been meaning to do, learning something new, meeting new people, having meaningful conversations, enjoying nature, the list goes on. The things that bring me happiness are not extravagant, and they might not always give me immediate pleasure. it makes me think of a quote (my favorite) from the book, “Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.”

&amp;#x200B;

Happiness is fulfillment, to me. As I reflect on the periods of my life where I was generally less happy, I notice that during these times I was often caught up in the pursuit of pleasure: drinking, smoking, playing lots of video games, etc.; putting things off that would have helped me be happier long term in exchange for the easy, instant pleasures of the immediate present. I think, of course, a balance needs to be had, and that balance may not be easy to find. I’m working on it personally, and looking back over the last 5 years or so (I’m relatively new to this whole adult thing), though I’m not perfect and I can often get down on myself, I have to recognize that I have come an incredible distance from where I was. 

  
Anyways, I just wanted to share one of my takes from this book. How are the ideas of happiness and pleasure thought of where you’re from? I’m also curious to hear what other questions/themes A Brave New World might have brought to your attention.

What about Viktor Frankl's first wife? Tilly Grosser?,catbamhel,"I'm in the middle of reading Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.

Something has been nagging at me.  He got a visa and had the option to escape Nazi Europe, but stayed out of loyalty to his parents (who did not get visas.)  I understand the sentiment.

However, Viktor had a wife he was married to at the time, Tilly Grosser.  

I'm assuming that the visa would have allowed him to take Tilly with him.  I may be wrong in that, please correct me if so.  If getting my wife out of the hands of the Nazis meant leaving my parents behind to certain death and torture, I would have.  It would pain me beyond words to do so and I would live with great remorse over it, but I would do it to save my wife.

Please don't judge me for my somewhat ordinary or old-fashioned view; when you get married, your spouse is your family and your #1 priority relationship.  Like it or not, this becomes the main relationship focus in your life and your parents, although still very important, aren't #1 anymore.  That is the nature of life long partnership.  (I realize it isn't this way for a minority of people, and no judgement for those of you who don't share this view; it's none of my business what consenting adults who do no harm do with their lives together.)  Frankl wrote about his great love for his wife and said some really beautiful things.

Anyway, Frankl's book is full of wisdom and extremely important.  But in the back of my mind, I'm like, ""Dude... you let your wife die.  I get you've got a really important message you've lived, but you coulda saved her and that would have been worth this book never having been written.  Because like you say, love is the point of life.""  And for me, that is the most important point of the book.  Love.

But its coming from a guy that made, in my point of view, a choice that is completely counter to his message.

Yes, I understand he loved his parents too and what about that.  Sure.  But he could have SAVED someone he loved.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Why the fuck didn't you save yo wife, my dude?  Ya could saved her from the Nazis, Frankl, and in view of what say about love, this makes you a hypocrite.  But much love to ya for saying this important shit nonetheless.  But still.  Just sayin'.",books

Just finished One Hundred Years of Solitude (spoilers included),GooberBuber,"I've been branching into different country/cultures' classic literature. I've read a bunch of French classics lately, and decided I wanted something new. I just finished One Hundred Years of Solitude, and just wanted people's reactions to some quick thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

First, it has one of the greatest opening lines of any book I've ever read. The repetition of that line throughout much of the book is very interesting, as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The first half of the book was fascinating to me. I thought everything from the fascination with simple technologies (like magnets) to the civil wars that were being waged was beautifully written and incredibly exciting. I was absolutely hooked, and each character felt very unique and I felt very connected to lots of characters in many different ways. I loved General Aureliano and Arcadio's storylines the most. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I thought the book started to get a bit repetitive and even dull. One big turning point for me was was when Meme (I think it was her) ascended to heaven. I was kind of on the fence with the whole magical realism elements to begin with, but this to me really didn't sit well in the middle of such a great story so far.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, too, I started feeling like the characters were less interesting, their storylines were dragging on, and I cared about each generation less and less. The ending was fantastic (and by that, I mean the last few pages... the revelation of Melquiades' notes reminded me a bit of House of Leaves). But in the end, I feel like there was a steep decline in the story as a whole.

The butterfly garden,k1k8krsna,"In all my book-reading life I ve never till now wondered this much about what the purpose of a book was? What is the author trying to say? What is the point of all this? In all my life, I have never hated another book viscerally as I hated this. After a point I almost gave up on the book but I just skipped whole passages to make sure that the girls got their justice in the end (I am still confused if they did) The author has gone to great lengths to make the story as twisted as possible filled with disgusting characters making us nauseatingly overdose on it.
And do they conduct enquiry like this? The FBI? In a non-linear fashion? Randomly. Well, I wouldn't know, would I?
And why authors who create such monsters feel the need to humanise them? Is it because they created them? A part of them? Who they are? And they are defending themselves for having even created them in the first place? They are monsters. Period.
The plot is twisted beyond anything that makes sense. How can someone come in a hostage zone, somebody who is especially a psych major, a student, someone with a semblance of humanity and not do anything. I think Des is more twisted than the father as it is unable to sort him either as a captive like the butterflies, or as a monster like his father and elder brother or as plain stupid.

Jane Eyre - Charlotte Brontë,urasaucyboy,"So I've read the book but I do have to say that it was the school version, which was modified as always, and so I was disappointed because so many important details were not there to the point where I found that the book was talking about just a little orphan girl who fought so hard to leave her cruel uncle's wife's house, fighting with bad school conditions, made a friend along the way, who died from a widespread disease at the time, became a governess to a wealthy man's daughter *at least who's supposed to be so* fell in love with this man and would just drop some dramatic lines about how she'd die inside if he didn't love her and so that all she ever wanted was to be loved by a man or whatever.

So you might be thinking: what the hell is that ! You've missed understood the whole novel.
And yes you'd be right but let me explain...

I'm basing this first paragraph on the impression that I got form the school version of the book but I know for sure that the original version is not like this at all, not because I've read it, but after I finished that class by 2 years or so I came across a video and it happened to be an episode of crash course literate with John Green reviewing ""Jane Eyre"" and once I finished watching it I was like : ""what the heck! This must be a review to another novel or something.""

Anyways, I got more interested in that novel so I started searching more about it and I was so fascinated to know that Charlotte Brontë was dealing with a similar thing and that there was couple of French lines in the novel and also that when the novel was first published Charlotte's name wasn't written *or was replaced by a man's name, I don't really remember, someone correct me please if I'm wrong* and that the novel was a mean for fighting for women equality in England, back in the time of Charlotte's.

Okay let me just break this down a bit, the impression I got form the school version is that Jane only wants to be loved by this man, while as for the original version ""according to John's review"" is an approach for equality in the UK back then, that's so fascinating to know.

I'm so mad at my school's modified version for providing us with such a version that even all of my English teachers disapproved of, because it's not really that good idea to let a bunch of middle school students read something that made them think like that, but now as I have a wider idea of what the book is actually about, I'd like to discuss it more here and see if reading the original version is worth it.",books

“Do you know Sqribble? A great tool for KINDLE publishers”,self_rectified,"If you’ve been marketing online for more than 5 minutes, you’ll know that lead magnets, eBooks and reports are powerful ways to build your list or sell directly for profit. But you’ll also know they’re a serious headache to create too. All that writing, designing and formatting… URGHH. Enough already!

That’s why a new product recently caught my attention — it’s called Sqribble and it’s an online tool that instantly creates professional eBooks, reports, whitepapers and other types of digital books with a few clicks or taps.

This concept isn’t new. There have been a lot of different eBook creator tools in the past. But if you’ve used most of them, you’ll know they all share the same frustrating flaws:

— They have crappy templates.

— They are buggy and unreliable.

— They often require additional tools

**What is** [**Sqribble**](https://nomadclicker.com/go/sqribble-access)**?**

Sqribble is different. It’s packed with professional templates, seriously good looking covers, and surprisingly, is totally bug free. In fact, the whole process of creating an eBook with Sqribble is satisfyingly easy and smooth.

Heck, it’s FUN.

But perhaps most remarkable of all… Sqribble comes loaded with some of the most powerful features I’ve seen in an eBook creator tool.

Here’s just some of the things this bad boy can do:

— Automatic table of contents

— Automatic headers and footers

— Automatic pagination

— Drag and drop design

— Add or delete pages

— Add your own media

— 300+ Google Fonts

— 50 eBook templates (in 15 different niche categories)

— 10 different eBook themes

— Automatically create content (woah.)

— Turn your book into a flipbook (double woah.)

Seriously, if that’s not enough to make you want to check this thing out, I don’t know what else to say. Apart from this — Sqribble isn’t perfect. Yes, it’s powerful. Yes, it’s going to save you tons of time and money creating eBooks. But it does have a few flaws.

**What I didn’t like about Sqribble.**

First, the upsells. There’s 4 of them! It's kind of annoying because they've saved the best features in them. Do you need them? Well, Sqribble works fine without the upsells so you don't have to, BUT if you want more power out of it I recommend grabbing them all.

**Here’s a rundown of the upsells:**

**Upsell 1 — Sqribble professional**

Unlock 150 more professional eBook templates (the best ones are in the professional version), graphics and even more ready—made content for all kinds of niches. (Just so you know, single templates from stock websites would cost you up to $450… for just ONE template!) Great for those that want more variety, content and heavy users.

**Upsell 2 — Sqribble Prime**

Get 15 premium “limited edition” new eBook templates added to your Sqribble dashboard every month. This will increase your library over time, and make you stand out from other users. It works out to less than two bucks for a template! (Much cheaper than stock sites.) Great for moderate users.

**Upsell 3 — Sqribble Fantasia 3D**

This includes 2-in-1 features.

**1)** Unlocks a 3D cover creation tool inside your dashboard, allowing you to turn “flat” covers into lifelike, 3d covers. Great for getting more attention and making your books look and feel more “real.” People do judge a book by its cover, so something to keep in mind.

**2)** Create “Flipbooks” that turn your eBooks into interactive and animated pages that turn like in real life. They can be linked to from anywhere online, as well as embedded on web pages with a single piece of code. This is really cool.

**Upsell 4 — Auto Job finder software**

If you’re going to be using Sqribble to create eBooks as a service to get paid, then Auto Job Finder is something that you need. It will automatically find you related jobs across various freelance websites and notify you so that you can fulfil them. A huge time saver and money earner.

**What I loved about Sqribble.**

Without doubt, it’s the pro designs, the simplicity and the speed at which you can create seriously sexy eBooks, on the fly.

And the fact you can turn your eBook into a flipbook is just icing on the cake. It just makes your books look and feel more “real” and that’s a good thing for engaging your readers.

The amount of customization is just off the charts too. You can tweak your designs, layouts and everything in-between to your heart’s desire. It even creates a table of contents for you, inserts all your content into a nice layout, play around with the formatting and design, add stuff, delete stuff… it’s only limited by your imagination.

But if the idea of too many options scares you… don’t worry. Sqribble is designed to keep things simple. You can just go with the ready-made templates, layouts and styles, insert your content automatically, and boom… you’ve got a pro eBook that’s going to grab more attention, build trust, engage your readers, and help you stand out in a sea of competition.

**About the creator.**

Sqribble has been developed by Adeel Chowdhry, who is a well-known internet entrepreneur and best seller, with over ten years of experience and has previously created worldwide hits such as Pixel Studio FX which sold tens of thousands of units all around the world. He’s known for creating high quality professional solutions and I expect no less from Sqribble.

**Final thoughts.**

The standard has risen online. These days, your eBooks can’t look like crap, or people just won’t want to optin, buy or read it. And because people are busier than ever, they will only spend a couple of seconds deciding whether your book is worth reading or not.

With Sqribble, you can instantly create books that scream trust, credibility and value, and attract more subscribers and sales.

Creating eBooks has always been a pain for most marketers, but with Sqribble, it really doesn’t have to be. With a few clicks, you can choose a template, add content, tweak the layout and then publish online… in just minutes from now.

Instead of spending hundreds — or even thousands — on freelancers, or even more money on fancy software, I would seriously recommend giving Sqribble a test drive first… I think you’ll be amazed how powerful, easy and quick the whole experience is.

Wolf Hall,joellevp,"I literally just finished reading Wolf Hall. While, in a previous post, I mentioned that I liked it; I don't know anymore. I am probably right on the fence about it.

Just finished The Trial by Frans Kafka. Spoilers,BulbasaurusDex,"The edition that I read was the Schocken Books edition translated by Breon Mitchell. It is the first time I have read Kafka.

First, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed the read. The premise of the story was enough to get me hooked, but then I was in for a ride. The protagonist, K., if w can really consider him that and not just a martyr, is thrown into an almost whimsical situation.

What struck me right off the bat was that K. had no concern what the charges were, he never asks, not that he would have gotten an answer, but he never bothers. The man is so sure of himself and his innocence that it's really of no value whether he knows or not. An almost pretentious disposition from the start. This isnt to say that he isn't aware of the gravity of the situation he is in, quite the contrary, he understands fully well and he goes back and forth between indifference and great concern the whole book. 

K. nonetheless finds himself in some pretty bizarre scenarios throughout. There's the men being flogged, the offices in the attic that somehow always have a nauseating effect, and the women who are drawn to him at a breakneck pace among other things. No doubt the reader gains a sense of K. because of these scenarios. It becomes increasingly clear that the man is very selfish and abhorrent, not once does he give you a sense of great care for his fellow man, perhaps that is the point, and perhaps that is the effect of the trial. This isnt to say that K. has no redeeming qualities, I just can't put my finger on them. K. is remarkably human in his endeavor and easy to cheer on as well. 

Now for my final point of this post. The ending is widely left to the interpretation of the reader. I felt that the end was quite fitting for the story. I do not feel that if Kafka had finished the book that there would have been a proper explanation of the reason K. was on trial. 

That brings me to my interpretation, K. at the end was finally starting the trial, to me the the talks of the ambiguous higher courts throughout were clearly speaking of the judgement of God. He being killed gets to finally start his trial at the pearly gates. This is also why there's only legends of instances of actual acquittal. No one can escape the judgment of God. We also hear that the more patient defendants that do not wish to speed the process up have trials lasting 5 plus years, K. wished a swift trial and that can only be done once he is dead. This point is further set for me in that the original title is Due Process which was cast aside in translation of course. We are seeing in my opinion the process in which the trial is prepared. That is also why evidence is disregarded by the court. The last two sentences of the book ""With failing sight K. saw how the men drew near his face, leaning cheek-to-cheek to observe the verdict. ""Like a dog!"" he said; it seemed as though the shame was to outlive him."" These two sentences are very important, though I feel the former holds more value in what's happening. The two men are observing the verdict after having stabbed K. This to me can only mean that he is only now beginning his trial. The last line is him coming to that realization himself. 

Overall great read and I look forward to reading more Kafka.",books
One of the best books I've read. A good girl's guide to murder - Holly Jackson,SooFieK876,"If you are looking for a Horror, comedic and thriller type book this is at the top of my list. 

Maybe a month ago, I had seen the book on a table (not much specifics for privacy reasons) and thought it was interesting so I made a mental note in my mind to read it one day.

It has been a few weeks and I had forgotten about the book completely. This was when I was recommended, ""House of salt and sorrows"" and was so interested by the description and trailer online that the same day, I went to the library I usually go to to pick it up.

Cutting it short, I couldn't find it (probably because it was just released) and decided to borrow a different book so my trip wasn't wasted. This is when I remembered about AGGGTM (A good girl's guide to murder) and went to the librarian to ask were it was located. After a search on the library computer, and me realising I was at the wrong floor, I found the book.

Finished it in two days and must say the book was a 9.9/10 (cause 10/10 = 1 and the book isn't a 1/10). The plot was great, likeable characters, good humour and a satisfying ending. If you have the time, I urge you to borrow this book and read it with a cup of tea (black, or maybe with milk and three sugars).",books

"Cochrane The Dauntless by David Cordingly, a must read for Napoleonic War fans.",Gabulek123,"This novel is about the life of Sir Thomas Cochrane, the British naval officer whose life has been the inspiration for many other characters like Jack Aubrey and Horatio Hornblower. A really fun read, it gives an interesting insight into the life of a naval officer who was often more respected and valued by the enemy than his own countrymen. (Napoleon called him le loup des mers, or the sea wolf). I really enjoyed the film Master and Commander with Russell Crowe and the whole plot is encapsulated in the first 70 pages of this book. Cochrane's career went well beyond the Napoleonic wars and he served as head admiral for the Brazilian, Chilean and Argentinean navies during their fight for independence from Spain. He was mercurial and often suspected that everyone was out to get him. If you enjoyed Master and Commander, you'll probably enjoy this book.",books

Books that casually engage with the fourth dimension?,k_r_k_o,"I recently read both From Hell and Slaughterhouse-Five. Coincidentally, both books deal with the fourth dimension in unexpected ways.

I have never been bothered by Lolita's content.  Although I have never before tried to read Lolita, I have read plenty of works that explore disturbed minds and disturbing subject matter.  Lolita is still more challenging then any of those works.  But it has nothing to do with the pedophilia. 

When I was deciding on which edition to read, I consulted a few different sources before settling on the revised and updated Annotated Lolita.   That was the best decision I could have made.   I don't know how anyone could read this book and fully appreciate or understand it without a guide, to be honest.  

The best part of this experience is that it is forcing me to read the book slowly.  I am constantly flipping between the text and the notes at the end.  After hours of reading, I am only on page 8.

Help me rekindle my love for reading,backyardzoo82,"Hi r/books 

My resolution this year was to read more books. To be quite honest I really haven't read books on my own for the past couple of years. In class one day my professor stated that he believes schools and academic readings have killed our brains. While some may thoroughly enjoy it, for most I makes you some what hate reading (because who likes 50-150 pages of blunt, emotionless, purely academic reading each night.)

Anyways, to be short, I feel that applies to me and I want to love reading a book again, so I'm turning to all of you. 

I would like your best recommendations of books that I will absolutely get lost in and LOVE reading every page and word of it. I know this may be broad but I want something that will suck me into the story and make me want to never put it down.

Open to any and all suggestions-- To be honest, I like a lot of stories of crazy, not necessarily devastating, but you know, just really cool war stories about WW2, Revolutionary War, Civil War,  etc. I also like wild stories about crazy like criminal shit, either gangs, white collar crime.

I can't come up with a confident interpretation of poetry no matter what I do.,Homeless-1,"Am I even supposed to post individual problems here? I don't know if this sub-reddit deals with this stuff, but I saw another post asking for help with poetry so I'm assuming I can.

To get the crux of the problem out of the way I don't care about poetry. There are times where I have to analyze it though and those times are in school. But **oh no!** I can't understand any poem thrown at me. The only times I've had an interpretation of a poem are when someone points me in the right direction. The problem is that once I get guidance I lose any ability to create my own interpretation and it becomes ""listen to whatever that other guy says because he knows what he's talking about and how to back it up."" Whenever I have to analyze a poem I try my damn best to stay away from anybody else because it's the only way for me to get something out of it that's my own.

Just read Pale Fire for the first time and I'd like to know your thoughts,benadryl_daze,"I’m probably wrong in a thousand ways, I'm just trying to gather my thoughts. I don’t even know if this interpretation makes sense.     

- Shade is real and his poem (not including the drafts) is a real and untainted reflection of Shade the man  

- Kinbote and Gradus are both inventions of an unnamed narrator who resembles Kinbote. There are lots of clues, but one big one is the way Kinbote’s voice seems to change near the end (“Folks”). Then the narrator kills off his characters (“Exit John Grey”, “my notes and self are petering out”). Also, I don't know how else to explain the library thing (WUL).  

- The ""petering out"" line has a double meaning because the narrator is clearly suicidal. He hints at his death/suicide in the final line of the book and throughout the novel (in the guise of Kinbote) 

- So, in this reading, the narrator builds an imaginary world grounded in something real (Shade’s poem, and possibly Shade’s murder as well) in order to satisfy his narcissism and to ward off thoughts of suicide. “I confess it has been a wonderful game.”

They’re are lots of books with extremely cool covers and lots of artistic expression on the covers, (Of which they’re several threads on this subreddit discussing) but often I see extremely bland and generic book covers that are just essentially colored rectangles.

"The Horror of Reality, Christina Henry",fidera,"I recently started reading books by Christina Henry. For those who don't  know her, her more recent tales are horror twists of fairy tails and I am ADDICTED. I read most of her books in about three weeks. What sticks out to me most is that as horrific as the tales are, they elucidate reality for many people. 

For example, Lost Boy is about the ""real"" story of Peter Pan, but what actually keeps you ""hooked"" (lol had to) is watching Jamie's transformation out of a domestic violence and emotional trauma situation. From the beginning, Jamie tells you that Peter seems a little shady but that he loves him and that he is the most special. But every page you turn you feel more and more horrified by the situation Jamie is in. Every page you want to scream at the character, ""RUN!!!!"" And when he finally does run...? Well, I won't spoil it. But it shows why so many don't  leave abusive situations.

The Giver of Stars Book Discussion,danimariexo,"Hi Everyone,

I wanted to start a discussion on The Giver of Stars by Jojo Moyes. I pulled a few questions from book club sites to start off.

&amp;#x200B;

* Did you know anything about the real life Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky prior to reading this novel?
* Life in rural Kentucky in the ’30s was definitely not for the faint of  heart. How do you think you would have handled it if you were Alice?  Would you have stayed or gone back to England?
* What did you think of the drama surrounding the ""Married Love"" book? What do you think was the real source of Bennett's intimacy issue? 
* Is Bennett a ""bad guy""?
* I loved the relationship between Margery and Fred.
* Did you think it was unusual for Izzy to be supported in working with the packhorse librarians? She came from a wealthy family.
* Do you think Kentucky was where Alice was supposed to end up?

Lastly:

Has anyone here read The Giver of Stars and The Bookwoman of Troublesome Creek? What are your thoughts on this article?

Need help finding my favorite childhood book!,Macwulf,"I've been searching the internet for hours now and I haven't had any luck. All I remember is that the book started out with the main character accidentally setting his house on fire. A man(I think) finds him and starts to teach him the ways of the world. Essentially there is a secret society that the main character has family ties to. People in this group have different powers and they use tinted glasses to help with their powers. The main characters power is that he can break things. He initially wasn't able to control his power because he didn't know it was a power, which is why he set his house on fire. That is about all I can remember. The title was very long and the main character had a weird name. If anyone can tell me what this book is called that would be greatly appreciated. Thank You!

Looking for a specific book! Google couldn’t help me...,Onibachi,"I’ve been trying to find a book I started over a decade ago and never finished. I’ve forgotten the name, but the premise has always stuck with me. Googling my memories of the plot has gotten me no where so I’m turning to you fellow book lovers...

The book follows the point of view of a family man in a world where a large portion of the human race suddenly becomes incredibly violent with no warning and begins attacking people. These people that “turn” do not attack each other. Part way through the book the main character himself turns and it is described as all the people that turned are basically going through a spontaneous evolution event and have become a new species and are only attacking unturned humans out of a primal fight for survival response against a different and threatening species. This new turned group of humans are described by the main character’s internal thoughts as an entirely new species different from the rest of humanity.

This was an incredibly interesting and so far as I’ve read, unique plot. I believe there were sequels and I would love to read more of this story and plot.

If anyone has any idea what this book is, PLEASE, let me know! This book has stuck with me for a long time through many new book series and stories and I’ve wanted to read it again for a long time now.",books

Finished the Vernon Subutex trilogy...,drjaded,"... and it blew my mind. 

While the first book of Virginie Despentes’ trilogy was released in 2015, I only paid attention to it in early 2019 - when the novels were adapted into a TV show on Canal + in France. To give you the gist of it - Vernon Subutex is a former record shop owner, whose life gets turned upside down when his famous musician friend Alex dies unexpectedly, leaving Vernon with his testimony on some tapes that are bound to attract unwanted attention. 

My sister lent me the two first books last year, and I decided to read them before giving the show a try. I absolutely devoured the two novels and fell in love with the characters, the vibe, the writing style - something that hadn’t happened to me in a very long time. I only managed to get hold of the third book last month, and decided to give it a try a few days ago, as I was missing my native France quite a bit (I had recently given the show a try, as it was based on books one and two, and was thoroughly disappointed - as was Despentes, I believe).

Boy, was it a wild ride. Without spoiling it for anyone who may decide to give the trilogy a try, it did feel like the third novel was fairly detached from its predecessors, but not in a bad way. I immediately found the same characters, ambiance, and style I loved so much when I first read Despentes’ work. If you’re looking for a fairly accurate, though sometimes cantankerous, depiction of life in Paris (and France in general), are fond of music and its icons, and aren’t scared by an abundance (seriously - there is *a lot* of them) of characters that you’ll both love and hate, go ahead - the Vernon Subutex trilogy has made its way to the top of my favorite books’ list. 

I would say it requires a fairly good level of French, mostly because the book uses a lot of slang, and sentences can go on for *a while* - the lack of syntax may be a touch off-putting for some people. I believe book one was translated into English recently enough, and the other ones should follow - can’t say anything about the quality of the translation, though!",books

"The Count of Monte Christo, ending thoughts?",infinitedreamer666,"Just finished reading The Count of Monte Christo. It was a fantastic read and I really enjoyed every bit of it. But still, it left me feeling a little bit upset.

To begin with, one thing I didn´t really understand was the forgiveness of Danglars. It seemed to me, that he was the one and only mastermind who intrigued Dantes downfall at the beginning. But still Dantes forgives him in the end. Yes, I know that his hunger for revenge was stilled, especially after wittnessing the tragic (?) death of Heloise and Eduard, but for me it misses the point a little.

Back to the roots of everything, it was Danglars, who planned everything. It was because of his selfishness, that he set up this trap for his fellow Captain. And as how I see it, Villefort, did what he did, because of fear, nothing personal against Dantes or something. Fernand did it for love, which I cannot really accept either, but do understand him but Danglars really intended what he did. What really confused me, was the very very bad tragedy of Villefort and the forgiveness of Danglars, this contrast, that the vengeance Monte Christo meant as the ""bringer of justice"", didn´t really bring the true justice for his past.

The Seven Or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortuna is a big beautiful puzzle of pain,brohenryVEVO,"I picked up this book because the cover was pretty. Then there was a map and a family tree and a very intriguing table of contents, and I'm such a sucker for that stuff. I was already in. 

The story is... long, for one. It covers about a century of time. It's a lot to squeeze into the page length, but it's paced really well. There's so much flavor. The book takes its time in the beginning to set up everything you need to know so solidly and beautifully. Throughout the whole story, the parts of Stella's life that are big and impactful and long to her feel long to the reader. The parts she disengages from and doesn't commit to memory feel rushed. It fits the story. 

I love the way this book raises questions and answers them. Every time is so satisfying. It's a framed story that gives you a lot of information upfront about the end of Stella's life, but you don't understand what any of it means yet. You have to settle in and learn all the context in order to put the pieces together. It's a big beautiful puzzle of pain.

There is so much pain in this story. I don't read or watch a lot of tragedies. I don't enjoy making myself cry. This book was worth it. The table of contents, while it's a bit of an enigma, is pretty open about the types of trauma in this book, so you won't be blindsided. But if you're ready to get your heart broken in those particular ways, I whole-broken-heartedly recommend The Seven Or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortuna.",books

Talentless writers and their take on Lovecraftian horror.,BeachSamurai,"Its silly that some people (had to censor here) had to go and build a family tree out of the Lovecraftian horror stories around these monsters when that wasnt supposed to be the cas3 in the first place.

Lovecraft never outright establishes a relationship between the great oldones and the outer gods. He mentions in Dunwich horror that Cthulu is the ""cousin"" to invisible entities called the ""old ones"" that are using Yog-Sothoth to break through, but thats a relationship between species rather than a family tree...you know how people say the cousin of the house cat is the lion or tiger....do you draw a family tree around cats and lions then??!

1. You cheapen the mystery and the great old ones qualities such as family.
2. Authors like Derleth and Carter watered down the mythos by doing this. Stripping it down of all the horror and rendering this into a B rated scifi...this is another reason why I never read anything outside the source. It takes away from Lovecrafts vision.
3. Lovecrafts writing is a work of art, like all artwork you look at it. Go create your own worlds but those people are talentless...what can people expect from them right??",books

Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury - Review,FuneraryArts," Evocation and nostalgia are the bases over which Mr Bradbury builds his monument to an inextricable trinity of time, place and people; evocation for the setting, sounds and scents of summer is effortlessly accomplished in light of Bradbury's masterful command of the sensual. His descriptions are luscious and vibrant, with a sense not just for lyricism in the prose and care for the aesthetic that lends sublimity and gentle beauty but also embedded in his writing is always an appeal to the emotional that, while sentimental in nature, is never trite or overbearing and instead showing more of an innate sensibility to the affairs around us instead of just being thoughtless romanticism.

There's also the nostalgia: for sights we won't see anymore, places we'll never return to, laughter that we won't hear again; but those glimpses of sadness Bradbury hides in his work point towards the ultimate creator of sadness in man itself, the inevitability of change or better said man's inability to cope with the reality of change. Dandelion Wine apart from being a breath taking portrait of summer distilled is also to an extent a musing on what it's like to grow up and lift the veil of reality for the first time only to encounter the ceaseless barrage of time and the randomness of circumstance as they crash against all we hold dear. It is to Bradbury's merit that this is never done in an apathetic or pessimistic tone but instead Dandelion Wine's speaks to us in a tranquil way, in an attitude of reconciliation between the inexorable change of things and our lives, suggesting awareness and satisfaction in the present, savoring the luxuries and little details of life hidden in every moment.

Bradbury doesn't shy away from depicting the darker aspects of the experience of getting to know life as it truly is: the uncertainty, the anxieties, the melancholy or the fear. And when he decides to take us to dark places to witness the ugliness outside but also inside ourselves we can only be too thankful he doesn't choose to linger there with us for long, for he is an effective writer and is just as capable of gifting us with paradise like images of childhood bliss or with the suffocating blackness of true despair.

The characters are likeable and if not always profound quite often very amiable and pleasant, people that cares for each other and in turn makes you care for them. A high point is Bradbury's perfect execution of similes and allegories, crafting sentences that become even more vivid and beautiful thanks to the comparison and quite often surprising you with the potency of their meaning which seems to come out of nowhere as Bradbury pens striking turns of phrase when one least expects it.

As said before the tone of this book is not a dark one, it's joyful, funny, witty, and almost all that brings to mind images of bright colors, nature and happiness.",books

"Warrior cats, and the problem with draggin on a series for too long.",Nahhhthanks,"Alright, everyone. Before you downvote me into oblivion because I'm not posting about your UwU 1984 or Sanderson, let me say something here.

I love reading. I always have, and it was impossible not to - my house was almost a library. And I love cats. I have had over a dozen cats in my lifetime. So, naturally, when I saw Warrior Cats by Erin Hunter in the library, I picked it up. I remember vividly the moment I saw it, the moment I started reading, and when I finally finished. It had been an experience. I was enthralled by the life of these cats - living in a community, caring for each other, battling for their lives. It hit 5th grade me quite hard.

These books shaped what I am today. Without warrior cats, I wouldn't speak English; not in the level I speak today, anyway. Without warrior cats, I wouldn't draw. Without warrior cats, I wouldn't have friends to talk to thru lunch, be it on discord, or tumblr, or even at school.

These books are somewhat the best thing that happened to me, in the long run. But they fucking suck.

The plots are overused. The ""forbidden romance"" is way too common. The spark and originality the series once had was lost long ago, between the 6th and the 80th book.

Oh, I'm sorry. I should have mentioned. This series has over 80 books.

Ginger protagonist after ginger protagonist, the series kept dragging on and on. With an audience of either old readers, that started from the 1st book 17 years ago, or new ones, there have always been fans to keep the books and merch coming. Fan creators on YouTube, risen from the ms paint and window movie makers amv, now getting professional animation and art jobs because of their passion for a book series about cats.

But as much as the series inspires people to develop their artistic skills... it also hinders them. It hinders their creativity. It hinders their ability to create, or their freedom to do it. What went wrong?

In the beggining, the series had 4 arcs, and a few Super Editions, that were longer than the usual books, to tell stories that didn't fit. Many agree that already in the fourth series, it started to go wrong. The Erins were not in control of the story anymore - it was the editors. It was a fan, crazy for traditionalism, that shut down creativity and logic and replaced it with her own opinion only. It was the moment the series spiraled out of control from the author's hand. Warrior cats has, unfortunate, fallen victim to the grasps of capitalism.

There is hope with this new arc. The antagonist seems extremely threatening and the POVs from different protagonists really emphasize how little we know about the villain, and how manipulative he can be. But after the fiasco with the last arc, maybe we shouldn't stay hopeful after all.

"My New Years Resolution was to read more books this year, but it’s taking me forever to read one, how can I speed up?",foxesjon,"Hi all, at the risk of sounding like a total imbecile, I love books, love the way they feel, look and smell and I constantly buy them only for them to sit on my bookshelf to never be read. I decided this year to change that and read way more than I have done in the past. Whilst it may sound silly, I find picking a new book up intimidating so I carefully researched books that align with my interests and I have chosen to start the year off with Wool by Hugh Howey.

Dostoevsky and religion,AromaticAlgae,"I was shocked to find out how religious Dostoevsky was. The way I see the world, and the way I interpret my actions and the actions of others, comes alive as I read his writing. It's as if they're a translation of my own thoughts that I am unable to put into words. They make me feel understood and like I am part of a mutual connectivity that spans decades and miles. The issue I have is that I am an Atheist. Before you jump down my throat, I'm not saying people who fall on any point of the religious spectrum shouldn't be able to enjoy Dostoevsky, but his writing highlights a very secular view of the world.

That brings me to my next point: I don't want to offend anyone, but I view religion as one of humanities biggest threats. I am interested in and confused by people who lean on religion to answer all of life's problems, instead of admiring the beauty and chaos of life for what it really is. For me, reading Dostoevsky makes me feel like I'm not alone in struggling with the duality of human nature and the absurdity of existence, and the helpless feeling that can come with it, without needing the pacifier that is religion. With that being said, I assumed he was just really good at getting into the mind of the ""other side"". He is a master at depicting individuals on opposite ends of the spectrum (thinking Ivan vs. Alyosha).

Obviously, my interpretation of his words is subjective, but he is ambiguous time and again- for example, the quote ""Without God, all things are permitted"". That is a very left phrase in my opinion, but it obviously can swing the other way. Idk, the way he saw the world and interpreted what he saw are not ramblings of someone who uses religion to cope with or understand human suffering and triumph. He simply thought too much to accept that cop out, because a cop out is truly what it feels like. 

Again, sorry if I offended anyone, but it doesn't add up to me. Also sorry if it's widely understood that he wasn't actually religious and I just came late to the party. I guess what I'm wondering is: Could his religious leaning be a product of the time he lived in? Was it uncommon (or dangerous) for Russians to identify as non-religious at the time? He didn't seem to be too afraid of authority or standing up for what he believed in.",books

It is a dystopian novel about people who are numb and not interested in world around them, politics or what is happening in the world, because they are focused on entertainment, and completely lost in phones/screenes and their leaders are leeding them to doom.

I Am Number 4 series,Razik_,"I was just reminiscing recently with a friend on how good the Lorien Legacies series was and it really packed a punch of deep rooted nostalgia. 

This series is not only one of the most captivating and influential books I've ever read, it is also opened a whole world of sci-fi/dystopian books and just books in general for me to read without it being a chore. 

From the characters to the plot the instalments just kept going in a linear direction of improving  itself and devoloping the story further. Its a series I recall having a variety of emotions like crying over some tragedy in the middle of devouring my pasta (which just left a slob of tear dredged pasta) or crying out in elation as a character does something awesomingly squeal-inducing. 

In conclusion I would just like to say that I love this series and that I would love to know if perhaps anyone else feels the same way on it because....I can't with this longing to reread it!",books
An argument in favor audiobooks,nanaismo,"Recently, I read a post of someone writing about the importance of the book *A Man's Search for Meaning *. I figured I'd check it out of the library, but they didn't have a hard copy in the library network, only an audiobook. I had never listened to an audiobook; this format has just never been on my radar. I'm also one of those people who joined the e-reader game really late because ""nothing beats a paper book"". Don't get me wrong, I still feel that spark of joy with a paper book, but not **EVERY** read has to be on paper. I read way more now that I've started using an e-reader. So, I figured I'd give audiobooks a shot. Maybe I'd have a similar experience as with my e-reader.

Sure enough, I'm a fan. But it's not just that audiobooks are another point of access to literature or a format that may make it easier to ingest more text; it's because of the voice of the narrator. It's a whole new type of media for me, like a hybrid of a book and a podcast.

*A Man's Search for Meaning* is an important read but it is not a light one. Frankl recounts many sad stories from his experience at concentration camps, and reading pages on these experiences would normally cause me to put down the book, staring off in pensiveness. This causes me to read a book relatively slowly, and not in a ""I'm savoring it"" kind of way. 

So my argument in favor of audiobooks is: much like a conversation, you are forced to stay alert and engaged with the content. And much like a conversation, the narrator can offer some reprieve by changing tone going into the next paragraph, using a brief pause for weight and then an up-lifting intonation to help to carry on.

For one other argument based on my experience, the auditory format also helps in digesting complex information held in long sentences. When I read technically-dense information, I often have to read a sentence 2-3 times, maybe more if it's one of those forsaken sentences that take up nearly the entire paragraph. If speaking this same sentence, a good narrator can put emphasis and breaths in the right places. Yes, I know this is what commas can do, but hearing is sometimes better.

I guess I think about how humans were first a species who perfected passing information down through spoken word. I love text. It's efficient or sometimes just plain-preferred. But there is something about audiobooks that plays to an instinct on which reading does not.

Of course, I understand this is all contingent on the quality of the narrator.

What are other's experience with audiobooks? Was there a specific book you listened to that put you on an audiobook craze? Or will you just never be an audiobook person?

Just finished A Scanner Darkly,expensivepens,"First book I’ve read by Philip K Dick - I saw the movie probably a decade ago, but I was a bit too young to “get it”.

I’ve experienced a lot of drug addiction in my friends and loved ones and this book was just like a punch to the soul.

One was about a group of children stranded on a ship. Cannot for the life of me remember why. The details I remember is they had a biscuit a day and one peach from a tin. It rained once in the book and they all scrambled to get the empty cans out to catch rain.

The second involved a scuba diver who at th end of the book ended up getting the bends from coming up to quickly.

My local library demoralised my drive for reading a little,gkbbb,"Now libraries, especially modern libraries, get a great rep round here for the role they play in our communities and for great reason. This post isn't bashing that at all, quite the opposite actually. I'd been putting off visiting my local one for a while but had always been envious of everyone here who describe all the facilities and benefits of modern libraries. 

I'm 23 and last year I started my journey to want to get back into reading. I only managed to read 4, but that was 4 more than the previous year so I took it as progress. But 2020 was gonna be a new year and I seriously wanted to at least hit a book a month, so today I set off to my local library. I hadn't been there in years but associated it with a lot of fun memories, like trips there as a kid with my siblings and later studying there as a secondary school student with all my friends. I was ready to go back and register a new library card (and potentially pay off whatever debt that'd remained) and determined to leave with a physical book in hand. 

Things were immediately off to not a great start as I approached the entrance to the library to already see it'd at least been reduced to half its size. That was upsetting of course, but you know at least it was still there, and its smaller interior showed off that the library was full. 

I went straight up to the front desk to register a library card but man, the dude could not have been any less inviting. Of course I definitely wasn't expecting any sort of congratulations or small talk or anything, but I also wasn't expecting to be made to feel like I was a nuisance. I'm English and this is London so I wasn't even expecting a greeting, but to be made to feel like I was an inconvenience somehow for wanting to register a card, and having to put up with huffing and just overall a generally unpleasant and cold interaction was a little surprising. But again I was there to further my progress and leave with a book. 

I referenced great threads ([like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/auacut/goodreads_lists_for_reddits_top_books_threads/)) that I found on this sub to help with selection, built a goodsreads account to keep track of my finds and then finally booted up my libraries catalogue to check for availability.  Now I know I've already mentioned a couple reasons above - but this was the real reason why I made this post. Not a single book I searched for was available. Not even ""its currently checked out right now"", but straight up it just wasn't available. It felt like such a rude awakening to remember thinking as a kid that the local libraries shelves almost went on forever, only to now be frustrated at its pretty woeful selection.

I own a kindle so my reading journey isn't hopeless, but I have been struggling with my retention for what I read, and was curious to see if holding a physical book would help at all. I also just wanna add here that none of the books I were looking for were obscure or too recent to have in stock. Literally just general stuff like 'The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy' or 'Meditations' weren't available. 

But yeah it hasn't been the outing I was hoping for. I do feel a bit demoralised at what my local library has become, but going through those threads did give me a lot to think about, and plenty of suggestions to get through. I do enjoy my kindle so it will probably stay my primary method of reading, and I might beginning taking notes while I read for the things I really don't want to forget. 

But I will also keep searching through my local catalogue or simply browsing the shelves for something I do want to read so this new pretty library card can be put to some use.

A practical questions so this whole post isn't completely just me complaining: 

- For people who do keep notes while reading, what kind of system do you use? Do you simply jot down favourite quotes or do you summarise how certain passages make you feel? I'm curious and would be grateful to know of any and all methods

- Also in general, for anyone who also finds it hard to retain what you read (both during a read and after you've read), what are some good tips to combat this?

Why do you read?,cougarkite,"*Warning, this is a long and meandering post so if subjective monologue's bore you, scroll to the bottom for some questions I'm curious about :) 

 I was not an avid reader growing up. In fact, I had a middle school teacher who was always on me about my lack of reading. This was in the early 2000s and AR (Accelerated Reader) was the required testing mechanism for reading comprehension. Nothing about reading appealed to me at that point in my life. I didn't have the attention span for it and only wanted to be outside running around. It was not until college, I became more interested in books. I think Vonnegut's 'Cat Cradle' singlehandedly got me on the right path. Though throughout my college years I was still only reading a couple books a year, not including academic works I was required to read for my major. As I progressed more in my anthropology degree I began to become more interested in story telling and ethnography. I loved Zora Neale Hurston's 'Mules and Men' Richard Wright's 'Black Boy'. I started to understand the power of storytelling through real life experiences. Later in college I took a creative writing class and was introduced to Stuart Dybek who's short stories I still cherish to this day. But it was still hard for me to find the time or mental energy to sit down and read a book. On a road trip just after finishing college, I found a book on tape of 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' by Robert Pirsig and was honestly blown away not so much by the book but from discovering the form of audiobook. Since then, my main mode of biblio consumption is through listening. There are some books I still prefer reading: Maya Angelou, Patti Smith, Faulkner. But for a majority, I prefer audiobook. First because I can listen to them while I work and second, I still have trouble focusing when physically reading so it helps to avoid that. 
Okay that^ was all to explain how I finally became into reading. Now to my post's query ""why do you read?"" I've been thinking about this recently because due to a new job in the past half year I have been listening to A LOT of audiobooks. Like 50 in 6 months. It's getting to the point where I've started to forget some of the books I listened to just last month. I can recall plots and basics but I fear I miss out on eloquent quotes, small details that might hold meaning, etc. It's started to make me wonder why do I read at all, well at least in the magnitude I'm doing it now. I do enjoy the stories, it's a good way to pass time at work while still consuming some form of art, and I've told myself ""you probably wouldn't have read these anyway so at least you're getting something out of it"". Maybe it's about hearing the story and taking it in at the moment and assuming parts of the story, characters, plot, etc. will stick or become part of your ethos in some small way? I do believe reading and consuming other's stories and perspectives make you a better person so I'm hoping more is happening to me than meets the eye.

"Just finished ""Journey Under the Midnight Sun"" and just... wow!",emtnaillirb,"Like the title said, I just finished the book ""Journey Under the Midnight Sun"" by Keigo Higashino, and it is seriously good. It is a mystery novel. I really love the way Keigo tells the story. He give us so many seemingly unconnected events and characters at the beginning, and the way he pulls everything together to reveal the big picture near the end is amazing. I also love the way he builds his characters as well, especially the two main characters. Like he never describes the two main characters directly. All the impressions about these two characters that the readers get are the impressions of multiple characters surrounding them, which creates a mysterious air of the novel. The ending is really haunting.",books

Catch-22,nkkphiri,"I had never read the book before starting a bit ago. I watched the Hulu series and liked it so I thought I'd give it a try...

I don't think I've ever laughed so hard while reading. The irony, the sarcasm, the wit, just transcends time. One of my favorite passages so far was about Major Major's father getting money from the government for not growing alfalfa. And he was so successful at not growing it that he was able to buy more land on which to not grow it. I about died. I grew up in a rural logging town out west, but have been living in the rural Midwest for a couple of years, and I still see that person around...

Novels for ESL Book Club,Pinkyyyy,"I live in Asia and run an ""English language book club"" where a group of us gradually read through English novels. The book club members all have English as a second language but they're at a high level. Currently I'm choosing the next novel for us to read together, and I wondered if anybody had any suggestions of books they think will be suitable? 

My goal is to find a novel that is interesting for a variety of ages (the club has a mixture of ages), the language isn't too difficult or obscure (their English is at a high level but often slang and specific cultural references cause them difficulty) and is popular or semi popular (so the club can easily get hold of copies). 

Previously we've studied a variety of stuff, they particularly enjoyed Jane Austen (although the older language was a slight barrier), Orwell, Ishiguro, Salinger and Harper Lee. 

Thanks for any suggestions!",books

To mark up and sully a book or not?,CDN_a,"I want my cake and eat it too? I have recently purchased a used book in rather good condition and like having it so. My question is do I mark up, dog ear, underline etc? My life's ambition is learning and so never read much fiction. I like to mark what I consider important sentences or points to be able to locate them later if need be. Now the truth of the matter is, I rarely actually do go back looking for a point I read  or have forgotten, but when I do and didn't mark the section it is extremely frustrating to me. So basically, is a book a tool for learning or an objet d'art to be kept in its as found new or used condition without further harm? I'm also an antique collector and would never consider modifying a piece in any way lest I make it worse. The distinction being that I don't have to do anything to an antique chair to sit on it, but a book quotation or important passage may be lost to me if I don't mark its location? Also I'm not speaking of first editions here, I do own some and of course do not mark them in any way, but they seem less readable to me? Many thanks for any help, advise or opinions you can share!",books
The enchanter from Nabokov,MissMango125,"I just finished this short novel a moment ago and I need to talk about it. Did anyone here read it?
I read Lolita about a year ago and it is one of my favorite novels so far. When I found out that Nabokov wrote a short Lolita-like story years before he wrote Lolita, I had to read it. And it disturbs me. 
Anyone who experienced reading Lolita probably felt a bit divided between disgust and compassion for Humbert Humbert. Well, I do. 
Now with the enchanter I feel so different. I didn't feel any compassion for Arthur, the protagonist, at any time. Reading this novel left me in pure disgust and I am so disturbed about the ending. Still I wouldn't want to miss it. Nabokovs writing style is one of a kind, I didn't find any other author whose writing can be compared to his yet. Every page is a masterpiece and I simply love what I read from him so far.
I'd like to discuss this book with someone who read it. Just to clear my mind a bit after reading.",books

Now for something different: Online Blog Novels?,Primexes,"I got put onto two different...er.. 'Books', recommended by friends who have interests in two totally different genres. 

Both of these 'books' are written online, and posted to their respective websites - with regular chapters being added. I have never read a book online (as in directly from a website, not an e-book) and it was a interesting experience. It made me think about how many types of these online books there are, as people who have reader support may just decide to skip publishing all together and simply post their writing in blog format chapters. Of the two that I am reading, one has overwhelming support and they are able to update very regularly, the other has a somewhat community and updates chapters at the end of every month. These guys have been going for a long time, and these books are huge... I mean huge. If anyone else knows of these style of books, i'd love to know of more - especially since the quality of these two has been overwhelming. 

The first was 'The Deathworlders' - a sci-fi novel on first contact, and human trying to participate and live in a galactic community. This novel started off the tumblr post ideas of ""Humans are Space Orcs"" and explores issues, politics and social caveats of human's entering a galactic society as a 'predator' species among 'prey' species. It covers so many topics on social issues, politics, war, human predation, anthropology and moral issues, while keeping within a sci-fi genre. Some of the ideas and topics explored by the writers cover some fascinating intricate details, as well as some flip flops over math theory and the sciences. The main characters change as the story changes, and they also explore some real issues... and something I appreciate, a more sensible approach to character relationships (I'm looking at you Sword of Truth!). 

It's a big read... with currently 61 chapters (and some sub-story chapters) that can vary in read length from an hour to 3 hours. Took me ages to get through the meat of the story, and every bit of it was fascinating for a big sci-fi lover like me.

The second was 'The Wandering Inn' - a fantasy novel about a girl trapped in a world that has some video game rules. If you are a fan of 'Isekai - 異世界' style stories, this is a pretty well thought out and planned book. The first few chapters, you can tell the writer is just beginning and honestly I was a little frustrated with the first chapter,but believe me... the story get big, intricate and there is a cart load of world building and characters.  The story begins following the protagonist around, and how she finds a way to survive and fit into the world - and as the story expands and more protagonist characters start emerging, the perspective of the book really changes. Each character introduced are really well written with their personalities well formed to give them substance enough that it's not hard to keep track of who is who and who knows who and so forth. At the point that I am in the story, I think I have been introduced to over 100 characters, and each of them unique in their partisans. It truly is a fantasy journey, there are some wonderful ideas and stories and sub-stories that make the world feel so large. 

Another big read... the books are upto volume 6, with each volume having 40 to 50 chapters... this one is on a roll. The world and character resonate very well.

The saddest part, is that not many people that I know would read a Blog Novel.. and I have been suffering for months now with no-one to talk too about these two absolutely diamond class novels. It's a weird format, the writers have complete control over their content... but how well everything is written has floored me. 

Please someone read one of these, I'm dieing to talk about them!!",books
